#Regional Management Considerations
While the proportion of the stock residing within U.S. waters is unknown, the 
assessment provides an adequate geographic representation of the portion assessed for
management purposes.  Collaboration with Mexico in conducting future assessments 
may be mutually beneficial.  No genetic information is available to inform whether
separate stocks or population structure pertinent to management exists.  Given the
relatively small area in the waters off of California where this species occurs 
south of Point Conception, there is relatively little concern regarding exploitation 
in proportion to the regional  distribution of abundance in the area assessed in this study.  

While the species does aggregate during the spawning season making harvest of the 
stock more efficient during this period, removals have been well within the harvest 
limits and the stock has not been overfished or subject to overfishing as a whole.  

Routine sampling of commercial and recreational fisheries provides mortality estimates 
to monitor catch during the course of season to prevent overfishing should effort increase 
in the future.  Analysis of CPUE of areas known to be spawning aggregations over time
using data from sampling onboard CPFVs and comparison to the trajectory of the population 
as a whole could provide information in determining whether localized depletion is 
occurring.  Eggs and larvae are expected to travel substantial distance before settling,
thus such areas should be repopulated from adjacent areas.  Time/area closures could 
be considered where deemed beneficial in maintaining a minimum CPUE the remainder of
the year, but are not necessary to keep aggregate harvest within the current harvest limits.
