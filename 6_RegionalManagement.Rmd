#Regional Management Considerations
1.  For stocks where current practice is to allocate harvests by management 
area, a recommended method of allocating harvests based on the distribution 
of biomass should be provided.  The MT advisor should be consulted on the 
appropriate management areas for each stock.
2.  Discuss whether a regional management approach makes sense for the species 
from a biological perspective.
3.  If there are insufficient data to analyze a regional management approach,
what are the research and data needs to answer this question?
