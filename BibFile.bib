abstract = {The interactive effects of ocean climate and fishing pressure on nearshore rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) were examined using historical commercial passenger fishing vessel catch records from California. Principal component analysis was used to characterize the dominant patterns in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over time (1957-1999) and space (10' latitude x 10' longitude blocks). Ocean climate explained 60% of the variation in CPUE and revealed opposite responses in northern and southern California. In warm El Nino years, CPUE was 4.2 times higher in the north and 1.8 times lower in the south. CPUE responded similarly to low-frequency climate shifts by increasing in the north and decreasing in the south after 1976-1977. Four geographic regions responded as discrete units to environmental forcing and fishing intensity: North, Central, South, and Channel Islands. Over time, annual fish landings declined sharply in the South, with fishing effort remaining stationary and high relative to that in the other regions. In the North, landings and fishing effort remained tightly coupled, with effort an order of magnitude lower than in the South. These findings support a management strategy for nearshore rockfishes in California based on regional responses to ocean climate and fishing intensity.},

We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery c...},

abstract = {We conducted a mark-recapture tagging study evaluating long-term movement patterns and broad-scale habitat use by groundfish off southern and central California. Thirty-two species (32,366 fish) were tagged in nearshore and offshore island areas from Point Estero, California to the U.S. – Mexico border during 253 chartered fishing trips over 4 years. There were 1,569 (4.9%) tag recoveries with recorded days at liberty (DAL) ranging 0 – 2,603 days (mean 288 d). Observed capture and handling mortality was 1,532 fish (4.52%). Median recovery straight-line distance was 5 km from original tagging site for all recaptured fish; 64% of all recaptures were greater than 100 DAL. Recovery distances of 50 km or more were observed for 51 fish among nine species. Longest minimum distances recorded were 510 km (342 DAL) by a mature olive rockfish (Sebastes serranoides) and 488 km (1,222 DAL) for an immature copper rockfish (S. caurinus). The two greatest DAL were for a brown rockfish (S. auriculatus) recaptured at 2,603 DAL and 3 km from tag/release site and a California scorpionfish (Scorpaena guttata) recaptured at 2,126 DAL and 0.3 km from tag/release site. Tag recoveries, though obtained primarily in recreational fishing locations, were not spatially restricted indicating the importance of rocky reef habitat and may reflect the extent of fishable, quality habitat in southern California waters. Large sample size and tag recoveries indicate use of multiple groundfish habitats and greater movement than previously suspected.},

For example, Pauly(1979) developed multiple regressions to predict the natural mortality rate of fish from growth parameters and mean water temperature. Ohsumi(1979) developed linear regressions for estimating natural mortality of cetaceans from maximum length or maximum age. In this paper, a general regression equation is developed o predict the total mortality rate of fish, cetacean, and mollusk stocks from the maximum age. It seems intuitive that longgevity and mortality rate in a species should be inversely related since animals from a population with a hight mortality rate would not survive long enough to reach old age. The nature of the relationship between mortality and maximum age is explored below.},

abstract = {Fish spotters are pilots in small aircraft employed by commercial fishermen to locate, identify, estimate the size of, and direct boats toward pelagic fish schools. Data describing species, location, and size of schools can be inexpensively obtained from fish spotters but are difficult to interpret statistically. We developed an index of relative abundance from fish spotter data based on extended delta-lognormal models and applied the method to data for northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). In contrast with previous approaches, our method used all available data, provided an index for northern anchovy that was proportional to abundance, and explicitly modeled factors (pilots, regions, seasons, and time of day) that affected observations by fish spotters. We also included information about mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature in models for a reduced study area and found that envi- ronmental data, where available, can be used to improve estimates of relative abundance from fish spotter data. Simulation results indicated that our approach is a cost-effective way to improve biomass estimates for pelagic species like northern anchovy},

abstract = {We examined the life history of the California scorpionfish in the Southern California Bight. Based on sportfish creel census data, the species was most abundant in the southern part of the Bight. particular-ly around Catalina, San Clemente, and the Coronado Islands. Trawl studies from 1974 to 1984 indicated that California scorpionfish populations varied considerably in abundance, with numbers peaking in 1982. Though the species usually associates with hard substrata, it was abundant over mud about the Palos Verdes Peninsula, site of a major sewage outfall. We think that this anomalous abundance was due to the presence of large numbers of a prey species, the ridgeback prawn, Sicyonia ingentis, which was attracted to the nutrient-rich substrata. . Female California scorpionfish lived to 21 years. males to 15. Females grew faster than males. Von Bertalanffy age-length parameters for females were L -44.3, k = 0.13, to = -1.9, and for males L = 36.3, k = 0.12, to = -3.86. Over 50% of both females and males were mature at 2 years of age.

abstract = {A Bayesian approach to fisheries stock assessment is desirable because it yields a probability density function (pdf) of population model parameters. This pdf can help to provide advice to fishery managers about the consequences of alternative harvest policies and convey uncertainty about quantities of interest such as population biomass. In stock assessment, catch-age data are commonly used to estimate population parameters. However, there are few catch-age analyses that use Bayesian methods. In this paper, we extend the sampling - importance resampling algorithm so that a pdf of population model parameters can be estimated using catch-age data and indices of relative abundance. We illustrate the procedure by estimating a 54-parameter pdf for yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea. The example demonstrates how catch-age data can markedly improve Bayesian estimation, and also illustrates the potential for significant biases in treating trawl survey abundance indices as absolute measures of stock size.},

abstract = {An initial step in catch and effort analysis is determination of what subset of the data is relevant to the analysis. We propose an objective approach to subsetting trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown; the species composition taken on a fishing trip is used to infer if that trip's fishing effort occurred in a habitat where the species of interest (the target species) is likely to occur. We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records. We test this approach by applying it to a data set where individual fishing locations are known, and we show that the method is an effective substitute for information on individual fishing locations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A 1-yr. study was undertaken to devise a sampling program which would determine fishing catch and effort levels of one segment of the southern California marine sport fishery. Personal interviews of fishermen were conducted at launch ramps, boat hoists, and boat rental locations from Santa Barbara County to the Mexican border. This report presents quantitative data and statistical estimates of effort, total catch, catch of preferred sport fish species, and length frequencies of selected species landed by private-boat sport fishermen. An estimated 55,000 anglers and 3,300 divers landed 182,000 fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans. The major components of the catch were 1) rockfishes, Sebastes spp., 73,000 landed; 2) white croaker, Genyonemus lineatus, 28,000 landed; 3) bass, Paralabrax spp., 15,000 landed; and 4) Pacific bonito, Sarda chiliensis, 12,000 landed.
