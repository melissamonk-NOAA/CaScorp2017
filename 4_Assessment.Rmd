##Previous Assessments

###History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock
California scorpionfish was first assessed in 2005 [@Maunder2005] using SS2 (version 1.18). 
The 2005 model was a one-area model for the population south of Pt. Conception to 
the U.S.-Mexico border. The assessment was sensitive to the inclusion of the POTW trawl survey 
index of abundance and the STAT team provided reference points for a model that 
included the POTW trawl survey index and one excluding it.  The stock was found to be at 80% 
of unfished levels for the model with the POTW trawl survey index and 58% for the model without 
the POTW trawl survey index.  The 2015 catch-only projections used the same version of SS2 as the 2005 assessment model. 
The 2005 model assumed removals equivalent to the ACL in all years from 2004-2016.  The 
2015 model included catch estimates from 2004-2014, and the ACLs for 2015 and 2016 were 
assumed to be attained.  Maunder et al. [-@Maunder2005] assumed no discard mortality, 
while the 2015 update applied a 7% discard mortality rate derived by the Groundfish 
Management Team (GMT) ([2009-2010 SPEX EIS, Chapter 4, pg. 290](http://www.pcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/chp4_0910.pdf)) was applied to the 
estimate of discards to provide an estimate of discard mortality for the recreational fleet.

###2005 Assessment Recommendations

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: The POTW trawl surveys (referred to as sanitation district 
  surveys in the 2005 assessment) conducted to track the impact 
  of sewage outfall provided a fishery independent index of abundance for 
  scorpionfish. This data source should be more fully explored for other 
  nearshore species of recreational or commercial interest. Methods should 
  be developed to produce a more statistically rigorous index from the 
  separate surveys.] \hfill \\

   STAT response: Data from all large POTWs in southern California 
   were obtained for this assessment.  All of the data were pooled across
   surveys to develop one index of abundance using the delta-GLM method

\item[Recommendation 2: An age, growth and maturity study for scorpionfish is 
needed.  Although there has been previous research on scorpionfish age and growth, 
the available information is not appropriate for stock assessment modeling.] \hfill \\

  STAT response: Age data are available from the NWFSC trawl survey from 2005-2016.
  There have been no additional studies on growth or maturity for California 
  scorpionfish since the 2005 assessment.

\item[Recommendation 3: Location information for the historic groundfish data 
of all species is currently available, in hard copy form only, from the 
California Department of Fish and Game. Putting this information into electronic 
format would greatly improve the ability to assign catches of all species to 
specific stocks on a trip-by-trip basis.] \hfill \\

  STAT response: The location-specific catches referred to above have been
  key-punched and are available in electronic form from the SWFSC, Santa Cruz.

\item[Recommendation 4: The SS2 model should be modified to allow for projections 
of user-specified recruitment at user defined values. It would be most helpful if 
the default harvest policies were then recalculated automatically for these 
user-specified recruitments.] \hfill \\

  STAT response: The status of this within Stock Synthesis is unknown.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
##Model Description
The mode descriptions in the following sections reflect decisions and modelling 
choices the STAT team made prior to the STAR panel.  Changes from the pre-STAR 
base model to the final 
post-STAR base model are documented in the "Responses to the Current STAR Panel 
Requests" section.  None of the data changed during the STAR panel, and the figures 
and tables reflect the post-STAR final base model.

###Transition to the Current Stock Assessment
The first formal stock assessment for California scorpionfish was conducted in 2005 
[@Maunder2005].  The 2005 model conducted in SS2 version 1.18 was first transitioned 
to SS3.24z as a bridge model, before moving forward to SS3.30.  During the model transition 
to SS3.24z an error was found in the 2005 model.  The harvest rate was estimated at the 
upper limit of 0.9 and could not remove all of the input catch (Figure \ref{fig:bridge_harvestrate}).  

The older SS2 output did not include separate columns for the observed (input) catch and 
dead removals by the model (output), which would have prevented the 2005 STAT team from 
discovering that the two time series differed (Figure \ref{fig:bridge_catch}).  The recreational 
fishery selects the largest fish and removes the highest biomass of California 
scorpionfish.  When the harvest rate hit the upper bounds as in the 1970s, there were 
not enough fish estimated in the population to support the large removals, i.e., stock 
estimated at 500 mt and the recreational catch was 100 mt. The stock was not productive 
enough to sustain the observed catch. A comparison of time series from the 2005 model, 
the SS3.24z transition model, and the base model from this assessment are in Figure 
\ref{fig:bridge_timeseries}.

Below, we describe the most important changes made since the last full assessment in 2005 
and explain rationale for each change.  Some of these items are changes due to structure 
changes with Stock Synthesis, and some denote parameters chosen for options that were not
available in SS2 (version 1.18).

Changes in the bridge model from SS2 version 1.8 to SS3.24z and SS3.30.03.05 include:

The way growth is modeled for age-0 fish has changed.  More recent versions of Stock Synthesis 
model length-at-age for fish below the first reference age (Amin) as linearly increasing 
from the initial length bin to the length given by the L_at_Amin parameter.  Since small 
California scorpionfish are selected in the POTW trawl survey data, the change 
in modeled growth has the potential to affect estimates of recruitment.  We took the 
following approach in order to mimic the methods of SS2 version 1.8:
 \begin{enumerate}
 
 \item Replaced initial value of length at minimum age for females with 7.26567 (the Length begin value for age 
 0 from the SS2.rep file).
 
  \item Replaced initial offset value of length at minimum age for males with 0.35366 (= LN(10.3483/7.26567), the 
  log of the ratio of Male to Female length at age 0 from the SS2.rep file)

\end{enumerate}

This assessment aggregated the catches from the commercial fish pot fleet with the 
hook-and-line fleet.  There were no measured California scorpionfish from the fish 
pot fleet and overall catches were minimal.  The commercial trawl and gillnet fleets 
were disaggregated as in  the 2005 model. The current model also assumes no discards 
in the commercial fishery.  The previous assessment combined the recreational party/charter 
and private modes into a single fishery.  This assessment disaggregates the two sectors of 
the recreational fishery and adds a fleet to represent the discards (party/charter and private 
modes combined) from the recreational fleet

The 2005 model was a length-based model.  This assessment uses conditional age-at-length from 
fish aged from the NWFSC trawl survey.

 The historical commercial catches were the same as those used in the previous assessment 
 and were updated using CFIS data from 2005-2016.  The CFIS database was used instead of 
 CALCOM because landings in CALCOM included catches from Mexican waters. 

The recreational catches differed from the catch history used in the previous assessment. 
In 2010 a catch reconstruction was completed for California [@Ralston2010]. Methods 
provided were applied in reconstructing the catch of California scorpionfish for this assessment.  
Both assessments utilized similar data sources including CPFV logbooks and MRFSS data 
providing catch estimates, with the addition of data from the CRFS program for 2004-2016. 
The main difference resides with accounting for discard mortality as well as landed catch 
allowing discards to be modeled as a separate fleet making use of length distribution data 
for discards for 2003-2016.  In addition, the recreational catch time series terminated in 
1928 for the current assessment, as specified for rockfish catch reconstructions in the 
historical catch reconstruction document, rather than in 1916.  The ratio of catches for 
the party-charter boat mode to the private and rental boat mode from the MRFSS period were 
used in combination with catch estimates from the CPFV logbook estimates back to 1932 in 
both assessments to approximate mortality the private rental boat mode prior to 1980.  A 
ramp accounting for the increase relative contribution of the private boat mode relative to 
the party charter mode from the mid 1965 to 1980, as conducted for rockfish in the historical 
catch reconstruction document.  A constant ratio of catch compared to the party charter boat 
mode was applied for man-made and beach and bank modes to provide an estimate of catch back 
to 1936 as was done for the private and rental boat mode in the previous assessment.  The 
CPFV logbook data terminated in 1935 and a linear ramp was used to approximate catch from 
1936 back to zero in 1928 for each mode as compared to 1916 in the 2005 assessment.

The bias adjustment for recruitment deviations did not exist in SS2 (version 1.198). We set 
1965-2015 as the range of years with full bias adjustment in SS3.24z to span the time series 
that was modeled.

Length composition data were updated and sources added for this assessment.  The 2005 assessment 
used the same source for length compositions for the commercial fisheries, the CDFW market category 
study.  The length compositions from CALCOM were all from single trips within a year and are not 
used in the assessment.  The measured fish from RecFIN (dockside intercept surveys) were disaggregated 
to the party/charter and private modes.  Preliminary analyses indicated the recreational private 
and rental boat mode selects larger fish than the party and charter boat mode (add plot).  

The 2005 assessment converted all length parameters to SL, which prevented comparisons with some 
of the growth parameters.  The values in the SS files from the previous assessment also did not 
match those in the written document.  The current model uses TL for all length compositions and 
growth parameters.

The previous assessment modeled selectivity using the double logistic, with defined peak, and 
smooth joiners for all fleets with estimated selectivity.  Two parameters were estimated for 
each selectivity curve, the size at which selectivity is halfway between the selectivity at 
length bin = 1 and one, and the slope of the left side of the selectivity curve.  This 
selectivity pattern has since been discontinued in SS.   All of the double logistic selectivity 
patterns in the 2005 assessment were asymptotic and are the same in this assessment. 
Selectivity in this model is assumed to be length-based and is modeled as double-normal 
for all fleets that were also in the previous assessment. This assessment mirrors the 
selectivity for the trawl and gillnet commercial fisheries to the commercial 
hook-and-line fishery.  The 2005 assessment included two surveys, the CPFV logbook 
and POTW trawl surveys.  The length composition measurement for the CPFV 
logbook survey are from the dockside intercept surveys in RecFIN and were updated to 
double normal selectivity in this model.

The time blocks for the commercial fishery is the same as in the previous assessment 
(1916-1998 and 1999-2017).  There have been no additional major changes to the commercial 
regulations since the 10-inch minimum size limit and the catches from the commercial fleets 
in the last 10 years have been minimal compared to historical catches.  The time blocks for 
the recreational fleets were updated to include a third time block from 2000-2005, when 
closures of the recreational fishery fluctuated annually.  Since 2006, the recreational 
regulations have remained fairly consistent.

The 2005 assessment considered six candidate indices of abundance (fishery-dependent: 
CPFV logbook, CDFW monthly block summaries, RecFIN dockside intercept survey, trawl 
logbook; fishery-independent: POTW trawl survey, CalCOFI, but only included two in the 
final model (CPFV logbook and POTW trawl surveys).  The POTW trawl 
surveys ended up being the basis for the decision table in the 2005 assessment, with 
more weight given to the model without the POTW trawl survey.  All 
indices were re-evaluated and updated through 2016 for this assessment.  As in the 
2005 assessment, we did not consider the CalCOFI index, CDFW monthly block summaries, 
or the trawl logbook for the current model.  The current model includes four 
fishery-dependent indices and four fishery-independent indices.  The RecFIN 
party/charter mode dockside intercept survey was not available at the trip-level 
at the time of the 2005 assessment and it is unclear how the 2005 assessment treated data record entries from 
RecFIN.  The RecFIN private mode index is currently only available at the trip-level for the CRFS sampling period, 
2004-2016.  The onboard observer database was also not available for the 2005 assessment 
and is used here as both retained-only and discard-only indices.  The CPFV logbook data
was updated and reevaluated from the 2005 assessment.

The fishery-independent indices are all new for this assessment, except for the 
POTW trawl surveys.  

Maturity was changed for this assessment.  The Love et al. [-@Love1987] study is 
the only study that estimated the maturity ogive.  The CDFW cross-shelf halibut 
survey used in the 2005 assessment to estimate the GSI were not used in this study 
as GSI is not an indicator of fecundity.  Fecundity estimates are available for a number 
of rockfish species [@Dick2017], but there is currently no information on fecundity 
available for California scorpionfish.  This assessment uses the assumption that eggs are equivalent to spawning biomass.  

In this assessment, steepness was set at 0.718, the mean of the beta prior developed 
from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish and updated in 2017 (James Thorson, 
personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).  

The prior for female natural mortality was updated to the median of the prior 
from a meta-analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).  
Assuming a maximum age of 21 years, the median of the prior is 0.2547, close to the 
fixed value for younger fish in the 2005 assessment of 0.25.

Due to the fact that the 2005 model was erroneous, a bridge from the 2014 catch 
update, which used SS2 version 1.8 and the 2005 model, was not developed.

Changes in the bridge model from the SS3.24z model closely matched with the 
SS2 version 1.8 model to SS3.30.


###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
There are twelve fleets in the base model.  They include:

*Commercial*: The commercial fleets include three separate fleets, one each for the 
hook-and-line, gillnet, and trawl fisheries.  The catch from all other commercial 
gears is included in the hook-and-line catch.

*Recreational*: The recreational fleets include three separate fleets, one each for 
retained catch from the recreational party/charter boat and private boat modes, and 
one for the dead discards from the recreational party/charter boat and private boat modes 
combined.

*Research*: There are six sources of fishery-independent data available for California 
scorpionfish, including the POTW trawl surveys, NWFSC trawl survey, 
the CSUN/VRG gillnet survey, the generating stations surveys, Southern California 
Bight regional monitoring trawl survey, and the recreational party/charter onboard 
observer retained-only catch data.

###Other Specifications
Stock synthesis has a broad suite of structural options available.  Where possible, 
the ‘default’ or most commonly used approaches are applied to this stock assessment.
The assessment is sex-specific, including the estimation of separate growth curves, 
and natural mortality.  Sex-specific length-weight parameters were input as fixed 
values.  The assessment only tracks female spawning biomass for use in calculating stock status.

The selectivity for the generation station impingement surveys was set to 1.0 for 
all sizes (SS pattern 0).  As an example, the cooling intake pipes at SONGS are 
18-foot in diameter and draw in seawater at a rate of hundreds of thousands of 
gallons per minute.  The water flow once in the generating station is one directional 
and organisms cannot escape, unless removed via a fish return system. Flow rates for 
the cooling water intake range from 0.27-1.2 m/s [@EPRI2008; @MBC2007; @MBC2005] and 
would not allow a fish of any size evade intake cooling pipes.

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not have 
been representative of the total catch.  Length composition data were removed from the 
model if less than one trip sampled and fewer than 20 fish were measured in a given 
year and fleet.  From 1985-1989, two surveys measured fish from the recreational 
party/charter fleet, the Ally et al. [@Ally1991] onboard observer survey and the 
dockside intercept survey.  The number of trips and fish sampled by the onboard 
observer survey was far greater than the RecFIN survey and were used in the model.

The time-series of landings begins in 1916 for the commercial fleet and in 1929 for 
the recreational fleet.  This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is 
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.
 
The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-21, where age 21 is the ‘plus-group.’ 
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 21.

The following likelihood components are included in this model: catch, indices, discards, 
length compositions, age compositions, recruitments, parameter priors, and parameter soft 
bounds. See the SS technical documentation for details [@Methot2015].

Electronic SS model files including the data, control, starter, and forecast files can be 
found on the [PFMC ftp site](ftp://ftp.pcouncil.org/pub/GF_STAR3_2017_Blue_Deacon_CAScorp/).

###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.05.03 by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.  The r4SS package 
(GitHub release number v1.27.0) was used to post-processing output data from Stock
Synthesis. 

###Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0.

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. 

Extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the input variance for all surveys 
and CPUE indices.



###Priors
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under “Natural Mortality.” Female 
natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior, 0.257 for an assumed
maximum age of 21.  An uninformative prior was used for the male offset natural 
mortality, which was estimated.

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update for the 
Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), which was endorsed by the Science 
and Statistical Committee in 2017.  The prior is a beta distribution with $mu$=0.718 and $sigma$=0.158.
Steepness is fixed in the base model at the mean of the prior. The priors were applied in sensitivity analyses where these parameters were estimated.



###Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. Time-invariant, sex-specific growth is estimated in 
this assessment, with all SS growth parameters being estimated. The log of the 
unexploited recruitment level for the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is 
treated as an estimated parameter. Annual recruitment deviations are estimated 
beginning in 1985, just after the first sets of length composition data enter the 
model.  The survey catchability parameters are calculated analytically (set as 
scaling factors) such that the estimate is median unbiased, which is comparable to 
the way q is treated in most groundfish assessments.  

The base model has a total of 113 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$) and 54 recruitment deviations,
  \item Nine growth parameters
  \item Eight index extra standard deviation parameter, and
  \item 31 selectivity parameters
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._ Five growth parameters were estimated for females: 3 von Bertalanffy parameters 
and 2 parameters for CV as a function of length at age related to variability in length 
at age for small and large fish.

Four parameters are estimated for male growth as offset from female growth.  The length 
at Amin was set equal to the female estimate.

_Natural Mortality._ Natural mortality is fixed for females at the value provided by the 
Hamel [@Hamel2015] analysis described above.  Natural mortality for males is estimated 
as an offset from the fixed female natural mortality in the pre-STAR base model.  Natural 
mortality parameters for females and males are the same and fixed in the post-STAR base 
model.

_Selectivity._ Selectivity for all fleets (except the impingement survey) was estimated as 
double-normal.  The recreational dead discard fleet has a dome-shaped selectivity and all 
6 parameters were estimable.  

For all fleets where the estimated parameters were asymptotic, parameters related to the 
dome were fixed, leaving only the position of the peak, the ascending slope, and 
selectivity at the first length bin as estimated parameters. Ten selectivity parameters 
related to the time blocks were also estimated.

_Other Estimated Parameters._ Recruitment deviations for the base model are estimated 
from 1984 to 2015.  The base model also included estimated recruitment deviations for 
the forecast years, although these 
have no impact on the model estimates for the current year.

Many variations of the base case model were explored during this analysis. Sensitivities 
to asymptotic vs. domed selectivity were explored for the appropriate fisheries, e.g. 
trawl and gillnet fisheries, as well as estimating selectivity and mirroring fleet 
selectivities. Time blocked selectivity without the time block from 2005-2015 for the 
recreational fisheries was investigated.  We also considered a model with an additional 
time block for the commercial fishery, but the length composition data were sparse.

This assessment includes discards for the recreational fleet, so time was spent 
investigating changes in selectivity and the most prudent way to incorporate discards. 
Length composition of discards from two recreational party/charter onboard observer programs and 
sensitivities to estimates of female natural mortality were explored by fixing other 
key parameters, i.e., steepness. Male natural mortality is still reasonably well 
estimated, but the estimates of $lnR0$ and female $M$ are not well estimated.  The 
previous assessment fixed female and male $M$, where male $M$ was an offset.  The 
previous model had two breakpoints for natural mortality, but the natural mortality 
for older fish was set to the same as for younger fish.  This model uses one parameter 
for natural mortality for each sex.

Much time was also spent tuning the advanced recruitment bias adjustment options, 
which were new as of SS 3.24.  Sensitivities were performed to each of the thirteen 
advanced options for recruitment, e.g., early recruitment deviation start year, 
early recruitment deviation phase, years with bias adjustments, and maximum bias 
adjustment.  The final base model sets the first year of recruitment deviations just 
prior to when length composition are available.

Several models were also investigated where steepness was either estimated, fixed at 
the prior, or at an alternate value.    

Sensitivities of the model to the spawning and settlement months were also explored.
The base model originally set spawning month to June and settlement month to July.
California scorpionfish are summer spawners and settle at a small size.  However, a 
potential bug in how  recruits move into the numbers-at-age matrix was discovered 
(Richard Methot, personal communication, NWFSC).  The final base model sets both the 
spawning month and settlement month to January, which is the equivalent to the settings 
available in SS3.24z. Parameters for extra standard deviation were added to all survey 
indices in the model because they were not well fit by the models considered.

_Other Fixed Parameters._ The stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the SSC approved 
steepness prior for rockfish of 0.718.  The initial recommendation for steepness was 
to explore the available estimates of steepness from Myers et al. [-@Myers1999]. 
Myers [@Myers1999] provides estimates of steepness for three species in the family 
Scorpaenidae, of which California scorpionfish is a member: chilipepper 
(*Sebastes goodei*), 0.35; Pacific ocean perch (*Sebastes alutus*) 0.43; 
and deepwater redfish (*Sebastes mentella*), 0.47. The estimate of steepness 
for the family was 0.48.  Information for steepness is not available for 
California scorpionfish and there is little information from related species 
that could be considered as a good proxy. A value of 0.718 (the updated 2017 prior) 
was assumed for the assessment.



##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices
Key assumptions in the model were that the population is a single-stock in the 
Southern California Bight.  No information is available on the portion of the population 
in Mexican waters.  The San Diego recreational party/charter fleet is known to fish for 
California scorpionfish at the Coronado Island in Mexican waters.  All catches from Mexican 
waters and landed in the U.S. were removed from the base model data streams.

Female natural mortality and steepness are both fixed in the base model, and sensitivities 
were conducted estimating these parameters.  Structurally, the model assumed that the 
landings from each fleet were representative of the population in southern California 
and fishing mortality prior to 1916 was negligible.  It is also assumed that 
commercial discards have been negligible and are not included in the base model.


###Alternate Models Considered
Due to the error in the 2005 model, the population from the base case of this assessment 
is larger in scale.  The majority of the alternate models considered were to estimate 
parameters, such as natural mortality and steepness.

The base model is age structured, but 60% of those ages are from males, and a number of 
ages were from younger fish.  Models that attempted to estimate female natural mortality 
were considered.  However, female natural mortality was estimated at 0.38, much too high to 
be considered a reasonable value.  The age data needed to estimate natural mortality (especially 
for older fish) is not yet available.  Male natural mortality was estimable as an offset from 
female natural mortality. 

Runs of the base case model estimating steepness were also considered, when female natural mortality 
was fixed. Steepness was estimated at approximately 0.8.  No data exist to inform this parameter 
for California scorpionfish, and the decision was made to fix steepness at the mean of the prior 
developed from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish.

Additional models considered and run for sensitivity analyses can be found in the Sensitivity Analysis 
Section of this document.

###Convergence
Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed 
values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better 
minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal 
distribution logistically transformed into each parameter’s range [@Methot2015]. This 
was repeated 100 times and the minimum was reached in 56% of the runs  (Table \ref{tab:jitter}).
The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001,
when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting 
the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability.  We did sensitivity runs for 
convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total 
log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.


##Response to the Current STAR Panel Requests

\begin{description}[style=sameline]

\item[Request No. 1: Add time blocks (1916-1999, 2000-2005, 2006-2017) for the 
  Recreational Dead Discard fleet same as for the Recreational Retained fleets.] \hfill \\
  
\textbf{Rationale:} Changes in selectivity of retained fish likely reflect changes 
in the retention of discarded fish.   
    
\textbf{STAT Response:} The model was run with the 3 requested blocks, or with only 
two (-1999 and 2000-2017) and the second block encompassing 6 years has only 3 years of 
data (2003-2005) on which to estimate selectivity (Figure \ref{fig:Request1}). The three 
blocks reflected the changes in management better (the closed years 2000-2006 show a 
selectivity reflective of the retained catch in other years) than two blocks and fit the data better (1 to 2 blocks 
change of 8.7 log likelihood units, 2 to 3 blocks change of 5.7 units). Overall, the 
total biomass in 2017 changed by less than 0.1\% and depletion changed from 0.574 to 
0.582 with the addition of the two extra time blocks.   


\item[Request No. 2: Combine retained and discarded catches in the Recreational index 
(use the number of CA scorpionfish encountered per angler hour as the CPUE metric).  
Include retained and discarded catches and length compositions in this new fleet with 
appropriate weights.  Make the CPFV logbook index a survey.] \hfill \\


\textbf{Rationale:} Concern with modeling discards as a separate fleet.  


\textbf{STAT Response:} This turned out to be more difficult than the 
STAR panel anticipated – the "discard fleet includes discard amounts from 
two fisheries, but only one has composition data associated with it. So while 
one fleet could combine the retained and discarded in the compositions with 
appropriate weighting, the other would still only be based on the retained 
compositions (or "borrow" information from the other fleet). Given the small 
amounts of dead discard overall and the finding of virtually no impact of Request 
1 on the model (while fitting the discard compositions better), this request was 
dropped by the STAR panel.
    

\item[Request No. 3: Explore the sensitivity of the Recreational Dockside PR mode index 
to the thresholds in the Stephens-MacCall filtering by halving the false positives 
and alternatively halving the false negatives.  Retain the true and false positives 
in each of these runs.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} The current thresholds are ad hoc.  
    
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} The original cutoff used for Stephens-MacCall filtering 
was a rounded value of an 0.17 probability of catching California scorpionfish 
in a trip. This resulted in something close to 2,300 each of false negatives 
and false positives. Halving these values was achieved by using probabilities 
of 0.1407 and 0.2308 respectively. The changes had relatively minor effects 
on the index, but  moderate effect on the overall stock size, especially for 
the lower probability which included many more false positives, adding approximately 1600
points to the CPUE standardization set, which resulted in a model with nearly 
10\% more spawning biomass (both unfished and current) than the base. However, 
the overall pattern was unchanged (Figures \ref{fig:Request3a}-\ref{fig:Request3b}). 
Since it is not clear which set is most 
appropriate, there was no recommendation arising from this analysis for the 
current assessment. Rather this highlights the need for more research into 
this topic.

\item[Request No. 4: Do a sensitivity to the relationship between weight and
fecundity.  Use a generic rockfish relationship from Dick et al. (2017)] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} There is a lack of information on this relationship in 
the assessment and the sensitivity of the model to this relationship needs 
to be understood.   
    
    
\textbf{STAT Response:} The base model models fecundity as proportional to weight. 
The model was run with the alternative where fecundity is proportional to 
length to the power 4.043 (Dick et al. 2017). This model had a slightly lower depletion level 
(0.531 vs. 0.579, measured in spawning output rather than spawning biomass) 
and a slightly higher unfished equilibrium biomass estimate (by about 1\%). 
While more research into this topic is warranted, its effect on the model 
outcome will likely be moderate.


\item[Request No. 5: Evaluate the selectivity for the impingement length compositions 
by allowing for a normal descending selex pattern.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} There is a strong residual pattern with fits to length 
compositions suggesting an alternative selex pattern for this index. 
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} Allowing for a descending selectivity pattern resulted in a 
reduction in the residual pattern. The run conducted, however, did not estimate the 
size a t the peak" selectivity (representing here where the start of the downturn 
would be) and the downward slope was quite steep. Estimating this value resulted in 
a change from about 20 to 17 cm for this value and better overall fit of the model 
the length and age composition data (by about 5 log likelihood points apiece vs. 
the constant selectivity assumption).  The scale of the population increased by 
approximately 15\% and the 2017 depletion increased to 0.598 (vs. 0.579). The 
resulting selectivity pattern is close to an inverse logistic with a non-zero 
lower asymptote.  The STAR panel and STAT agreed that this pattern is more 
realistic and fits the data better than the model with full selectivity at 
all ages and sizes, and should be included in the final base model.   
    
    
\item[Request No. 6: Investigate the commercial net length data sources to see if 
they are representative of the different mesh sizes used.  For a sensitivity analysis, 
turn off the selex mirroring to the hook-and-line fleet and estimate a fleet-specific selex.  
An additional sensitivity analysis, remove the length comps. from this fleet and 
continue to mirror the selex to the hook-and-line fleet.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} These lengths do not fit well in the current model.  It is 
not clear if the length comps. match the temporal changes in allowable mesh sizes. 
  
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} When estimated independently for the commercial net fleet, 
the selectivity pattern moved far to the right of that for the hook and line fleet. 
Depletion (0.575 vs 0.579) and stock size decreased slightly with this change, and 
the fit to length composition data improved by 20 log likelihood points. Since 
there is relatively little length data from the commercial net fishery, dropping 
that length data and continuing to mirror selectivity made little change from the 
base model, but the resulting model does not accurately reflect the apparent 
selectivity of the net fleet. The STAR panel and STAT agreed that the independently 
estimated selectivity for the net fleet is more realistic and fits the data better, 
and should be included in the final base model. Since the peak value parameter 
hit the upper bound, it should be fixed in the final model.
    
    
\item[Request No. 7: Turn off the mirroring of the gillnet survey to the POTW survey 
selex and allow the model to estimate a survey-specific selex.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} The length comps. do not fit well in the current model. 

\textbf{STAT Response:} The model run following this change did result in a 
very different selectivity pattern (nearly a straight diagonal line up from 
zero to the 40 cm), however, the hessian did not converge. Dropping the gillnet 
data altogether had very little impact on the model. It was agreed to drop this 
fleet from the final base model, and recommend further investigation of this data 
for future use.
    
    
\item[Request No. 8: Plot the CalCOFI  sea surface temperature index for Pacific sardine 
with the estimated CA scorpionfish recruitment deviations.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} To investigate the hypothesis of warmer water influencing positive recruitment.  
    
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} The annual CalCOFI sea surface temperature index was correlated 
with the model estimated recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:Request8}). This helps 
explain the pattern of 
alternating periods of positive and negative recruitment deviations in the model. 
The panel recommends further investigation of possible predictors with the goal of 
finding a better indicator of California scorpionfish recruitment to be considered 
for use within a model and for forecasting. 
    
    
\item[Request No. 9: Provide a model run where recruitment deviations are not estimated.  
Also, provide a model run with a lower sigma-r (0.3).] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} There is concern that the higher recruitment deviations are not 
realistic and they sustain the trends we see in stock size regardless of removals.   
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} A run with no recruitment deviations resulted in a higher unfished 
equilibrium biomass, but did not fit the data nearly as well (by over 110 log likelihood units). 
With half the sigma-r value, the overall scale of the stock did not change from the base, 
but the variation over time was suppressed somewhat (Figure \ref{fig:Request9}). Since the results of Request 8 
indicated potential underlying environmental drivers for the recruitment patterns in 
the base model, it was agreed that the original sigma-r (0.6) was reasonable.  
    
    
\item[Request No. 10: Prepare a new base model that changes July 26 base model as follows:] \hfill \\
       
\begin{itemize}
\item Model the commercial net fishery with its own selex curve with two selex blocks matching 
the other commercial fisheries.  Peak selex parameter needs to be fixed (not estimated)
\item Model the impingement data with a descending selex pattern, including estimation of 
the peak parameter
\item Drop the Gillnet survey from the model
\item Fix M for both sexes combined based on a max. age of 23 years (M = 0.235) (determined 
by averaging the third oldest estimated ages of each sex)
\item Retune and jitter
\item Evaluate diagnostics to ensure this is a sound model.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rationale:} These changes were agreed to by the STAT and STAR Panel.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} These changes consitute a new base model. 
    
    
\item[Request No. 11: Building on the new base model, prepare bracketing runs on M 
that use the 12.5\% (M = 0.164) and 87.5\% (M = 0.335) quantiles of the Hamel prior 
distribution.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} To consider for a decision table. 
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} While the low value for M produced a reasonable result, 
    the high value resulted in an incredibly large biomass. This request was modified below.
 
    
\item[Request No. 12: For the high state of nature, explore an M such that the ratio of ending 
SSB in the high state of nature to the base case is equal to that ratio from the base case 
(M = 0.235) to the low state of nature (M = 0.164).] \hfill \\


\textbf{Rationale:} The first exploration of a high state of nature in a potential decision 
table provided unrealistic results and a narrower range of Ms did not provide adequate contrast between states of nature.
  
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} The high value of M which meets the above criteria was found to be 
    0.2745. This, along with the low value (M = 0.164) results in a reasonable bracketing of 
    the uncertainty (Figure \ref{fig:Request12}). 

\item[Request No. 13: Provide a draft decision table with the 3 states of nature assuming the 
following harvest control rule for a catch stream:  ACL = ABC, $P*$=0.45, sigma = 0.36; 
ABC buffer = 4.4\% (i.e., ABC is $0.956*OFL$).] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} This is a reasonable catch stream to demonstrate the outcomes of a 
    potential decision table.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} See the final decision table for appropriate values.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
##Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

The base model is sex-specific for the growth parameters. Key productivity parameters 
are fixed at measures of central tendency from prior distributions endorsed by the 
PFMC’s SSC due to the models’ inabilities to estimate reasonable parameter values. 
Specifically, steepness of the assumed Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship 
was fixed at 0.718. In the final base models the instantaneous rate of annual natural 
mortality was fixed at 0.235 for females and males. 

###Parameter Estimates
The base model produces reasonable estimates of growth parameters, for both males and 
females (Figure \ref{fig:vonB_compare}).  The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient $k$ 
for females was estimated close to the external estimate, 0.2496 externally and 0.2503 
within SS.  For males, the von Bertalanffy $k$ parameter was estimated at 0.2325 externally 
and 0.1864 within SS.  The female estimated $L_{inf}$ was 33.312 and 28.4207 for males.
Females grow faster than males and reach a maximum size greater than the males.  

Selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets.  The estimated 
selectivities for all fleets within the model are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}.  The commercial fishery selectivities are 
all asymptotic with the trawl and gillnet fisheries mirroring the hook-and-line 
fishery.  Maximum selectivity for the commercial fleet is reached at about  26 cm 
from 1916-1998 and 28 cm from 1999-2016 (Figure \ref{fig:sel03_len_timevary_surf_flt1sex1}). 
The shift in selectivity is due to the implementation of the 10-inch size limit for the 
commercial fishery in 1999.   The recreational private mode sector selects the largest 
fish, with full selectivity at 41 cm.  The time blocked selectivity does not show a 
major shift in selectivity when the fishery was closed for portions of 2001-2005 (Figure 
\ref{fig:sel03_len_timevary_surf_flt4sex1}.  This can be explained by the fact the length 
composition data from the dockside intercept survey contains a large number of observed 
fish when the fishery was closed.  The recreational private mode also selects the 
largest fish, and there is no available information on discards from this fleet. 
There is a distinct shift in the selectivity for the retained-catch recreational 
party/charter fleet, with the onboard observer retained-catch fleet mirrored to 
the other recreational party/charter fleet.  Prior to the implementation of a 
10-in minimum size limit the size at maximum selectivity was 36 cm, from 2001-2005 
it was 31 cm and since 2006 the size at maximum selectivity is at 26 cm (Figure \ref{fig:sel03_len_timevary_surf_flt5sex1}).   The recreational party/charter mode 
discard-catch dome-shaped selectivity reflects the discarding of small fish due to 
the size limit and also the discarding of smaller fish prior to the 10-in minimum 
size limit due to angler preference for larger fish.  The selectivity of the discard 
fleet does not go to 0, because some larger fish are still discarded, either due to 
angler preference, bag limits, and/or fishery closure.  The onboard observer data also 
indicates that there are higher discards when an aggregation of California scorpionfish 
was found, i.e., hundreds of fish may be caught at a single fishing stop and some are 
discarded.

All of the survey selectivity curves were asymptotic and none had time blocks. 
The Southern California Bight regional monitoring trawl survey uses the same gear 
as the POTW trawl surveys. All of the three trawl surveys reach full 
selectivity around 24 cm. The selectivity for the gillnet survey is mirrored to the 
trawl survey because small 1”-2” mesh sizes were used.  

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  The model estimated a 
small added variances for the recreational private mode of 
`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecPR(4)", 3], 3)` and 
the recreational party/charter discard fleet of 
`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecDD(6)", 3], 3)`. The 
estimated added variance was highest for the recreational party/charter retained-catch 
fleet (`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecPC(5)", 3], 3)`), 
the POTW trawl survey 
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Sanitation(7)", 3], 3)`), 
and the NWFSC trawl survey 
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSCTrawl(8)", 3], 3)`).  

Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1965 to 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:recdevs2_withbars}). 
Estimates of recruitment suggest that the California scorpionfish population is characterized
by variable recruitment with occasional strong recruitments and periods of low recruitment
(Figures \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} and 
\ref{fig:recdevs2_withbars}). The four lowest recruitments
(in ascending order) occurred in 2012, 2011, 1981, and 1973. There are large estimates 
of recruitment in 1985, 1993, and 2015. The 2015 recruitment
event can be observed in the length and conditional length at age compositions from the 
survey data. 

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also shown. The stock is predicted to 
have never fallen to low enough levels that the steepness is obvious. Steepness was 
not estimated in this model, but sensitivities to an alternative value of steepness 
is discussed below.

###Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations from the NWFSC trawl survey 
are all discussed below.  

The fits to the four fishery CPUE and four survey indices are shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_RecPR} - \ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_SCBSurvey}. Extra 
standard error was estimated for all eight of the indices.  The indices for the 
recreational private mode and dead-discard fleets were fit relatively well by the 
model.  The recreational party/charter retained-catch index was fit moderately well 
in parts of the time series, but did not capture the increases observed in the late 
1990s.  The extra variability added to this index was also large.   The onboard 
observer retained-only catch index was fit well by the model except for the two 
lowest years, 2003 and 2015.   

The POTW trawl survey index was fit well by the model, except for the highest four 
years from 1979-1982, where the fit is estimated lower than the added uncertainty.
The NWFSC trawl survey index is flat and fit well by the model, except for in 2013, 
the highest year in the index, with also high uncertainty.  The gillnet survey index was 
not well fit by the model; the model fit did not capture the trend observed in the standardized 
index.  The decision was made during the STAR panel to exclude the gillnet survey and 
associated length data from the base model. The Southern California Bight trawl survey, 
conducted every 5 years, was 
also not well fit by the model.  The standardized index from the Bight trawl survey 
showed peaks in 1994 and 2004, which were not fit by the model.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths observed by 
year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.  Detailed fits to the 
length data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix 
\ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fits-to-length-composition-data}.  Aggregate fits by fleet 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__aggregated_across_time}. Overall, the 
length composition data for the commercial hook-and-line, commercial trawl, POTW trawl 
survey, recreational private, and party/charter fleets all fit well.  The fits to the
recreational discard fleet by year were variable, and were worse in years with small 
sample sizes; however, the aggregate fit is reasonable.  The sample sizes by year for 
each of the gillnet, impingement, and Bight trawl surveys were small compared to the
fisheries.  The fit to the data varies by year and does not capture the high proportion 
of small fish observed in the impingement survey, especially in 2013.

Fits to the aggregated and yearly length composition data from the commercial gillnet fishery 
are not well fit.  The selectivity for this fishery is mirrored to the commercial 
hook-and-line fishery and the sample sizes of the number of measured fish and trips
is small compared to other fleets.  California scorpionfish are also not a target
species for the gillnet fishery, but are retained most commonly by the seabass 
and halibut fisheries as bycatch.  The minimum mesh size for the gillnet fishery 
ranges from 3.5 - 6 inches depending on the year and season.

The NWFSC trawl survey lengths were well estimated for males and females in aggregate 
by the model. California scorpionfish are not one of the more common species observed 
in this survey, with sample size all under 10 hauls per year.

The observed and expected conditional age-at-length fits are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:mod1_4_comp_condAALfit_Andre_plotsflt8mkt0_page1} for the  NWFSC trawl survey observations. 
The fits generally match the observations for fish smaller than 30 cm. Some outliers 
are apparent with large residuals. 

The age data were also weighted according to Francis weighting which adjust the weight 
given to a data set based on the fit to the mean age by year. 
The mean ages from the fishery appear to have declined in recent years which could be 
due to incoming cohorts (Figure \ref{fig:comp_condAALfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_condAgeNWFSCTrawl}).  
Smaller fish were also observed in the POTW trawl and impingement surveys in the 
(Figures \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Sanitation} and \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Impingement}).  The mean length in the 
recreational private and party/charter fleets increased over time (Figures \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_RecPR} and 
\ref{fig:comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_RecPC}). The length composition of the recreational fleet discards was smaller in the 1980s 
and hovers around the 10-in minimum size limit in the 2000s (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_RecDD}).



###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Data weighting according to the harmonic mean.
  
  \item Removal of the POTW trawl survey index (axis of uncertainty from the 2005 assessment)
  
  \item Dome-shaped selectivity for the NWFSC trawl survey and gillnet survey
  
  \item Estimating female natural mortality
  
  \item Estimating steepness
  
  \item Assume the same fixed natural mortality for males and females
  
  \item Drop data sources, one at a time
  
  
\end{enumerate}

A number of changes were made since the 2005 assessment, and sensitivities to the current 
base model included changing or fixing a number of parameters to the same as the 2005 
assessment, as well as a number of sensitivities to modelling choices made in developing the 
current base model (Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1} and \ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1_1}). 
A number of metrics ($SB_0$, $SB_{2017}$, $SB_{2017}/SB_0$, and $Yield_{SPR}$) relative to the 
pre-STAR base model are presented in Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_all} and show that the 
impingement length composition data are the data source to which the model is most sensitive.
The model is also sensitive to the choice of data weighting.

Data weighting is an area of uncertainty for stock assessment and research is ongoing to 
determine the effects of data weighting and the most appropriate initial sample sizes for 
length and age composition data.  The base model used the 
Stewart sample sizes for the fishery data and number of trips for all survey sample sizes. 
Weighting the data by the harmonic mean resulted in a model with a total likelihood between 
the base model, which uses the Francis method for weighting, and the model with default weights. 
The Francis weights in the base model were stable, and did not tend to serially decrease (downweight) 
any of the datasets, which has been seen in other assessments.  

The POTW trawl survey index was the axis of uncertainty in the 2005 assessment. 
The stock was estimated to be at 80% depletion in 2005 with the POTW trawl survey 
index and at 58% without the index. The current assessment 
has a number of new data sources, including new indices, length data, and conditional age-at-length data 
available.  Removing the POTW trawl survey index and length composition data from the current base model 
did not have a large effect on the model.  Depletion dropped from 0.574 to 0.53, but this is a fairly 
small change compared to the effect on the 2005 model.

The 2005 assessment fixed natural mortality at 0.25 for males and females, and 
steepness at 0.7.  A sensitivity of fixing male and female natural mortality to 0.257, 
increased depletion from 0.574 to 0.594, but did not have a large overall effect on 
the model.  A sensitivity was also run estimating a single natural mortality rate (0.252) 
and steepness (0.88) Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_spawnbio}.  

Sensitivity of the base model to each of the data sources was also explored (Figures 
\ref{fig:sensitivity2_spawnbio} and \ref{fig:sensitivity2_spawnbio}).  The time series 
of spawning biomass was most sensitive to the impingement survey length composition. 
Without the impingement length composition, the relative time series is the same, but the 
total biomass is almost double the base model. However, dropping the impingement index 
and estimating a single natural mortality rate for both sexes reduces the total biomass 
towards the base model.  Natural mortality is also reasonably estimated at 0.19.  In the 
sensitivity run where both natural mortality (0.19, same for males and females) and steepness (0.88)
were estimated produces both a reasonable estimate for natural mortality and a value of steepness 
that was high, but not estimated at the parameter bound.


###Retrospective Analysis
A 4-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data 
only through 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, progressively (Table \ref{tab:retro}). 
The initial population size and estimation of trends in spawning biomass in the 
retrospective runs were slightly lower than the base model (Figure \ref{fig:retro_spawnb}). 
The initial scale of the spawning population was basically unchanged for all of these retrospectives.  

The recruitment deviations in the more recent years shrink towards zero the more years 
are removed from the model (Figure \ref{fig:retro_recdev}).


###Likelihood Profiles
Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality 
values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter 
at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter 
value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately 
log($R_0$) of 8.0 (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles}).  The recreational private mode fishery
minimized at a smaller value of $R_0$ whereas the gillnet survey, recreational discard 
and commercial gillnet fisheries indicated a higher value of $R_0$ (Figure 
\ref{fig:profile_R0_piner}). The age and recruitment data indicated a higher value of 
$R_0$ and were minimized at the highest value in the profile (Figure \ref{fig:profile_R0_like}). 
Over the range of values of $R_0$, depletion ranged from 0.53-0.70 (Figure \ref{fig:profile_R0_depl}).

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood was essentially flat between values of 
0.57-0.87 (Figure \ref{fig:profile_h_piner} and Table \ref{tab:like_profiles}).  


Likelihood components by data source show that the fishery age data support a low 
steepness value, but the other data sources higher value for steepness (Figure 
\ref{fig:profile_h_like}).  The 
impingement, POTW trawl survey, and recreational private mode fleets support higher 
values of steepness while the other surveys are relatively uninformative.  The 
relative depletion for `r spp` changes very little (0.51-0.60) across different
assumed values of steepness (Figure \ref{fig:profile_h_depl}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a natural mortality value of 0.38, 
the profile is relatively flat for the priors, index data, and recruitment (Figure
\ref{fig:profile_m_like}).  The age data likelihood contribution was minimized at
natural mortality values ranging from 0.035-0.40, and the length data contribution
was minimized as the largest value of $M$ run, 0.40 (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles}). 
The virgin biomass was estimated at unreasonable levels (~$2e^{12}$) when $M$ was fixed 
at 0.33 and greater. The impingement survey was the only fleet for which the likelihood profile over 
$M$ was not relatively flat (Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_piner}). The relative depletion for
`r spp`  ranged from 0.48-0.80 across alternative values of natural mortality 
(Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_depl}).



###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 

The predicted spawning biomass from the base model shows an initial decline starting in 
1970, with two year of low spawning biomass in 1976 and 1977.  From the late 1970s 
to the mid-2000s the population follows a cyclical pattern (driven by recruitment pulses) 
and then declines until 2015.  The last two years of the model indicate an increase in spawning biomass. 
(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). Since 2015, 
the spawning biomass has been increased due to 
lower catches and a high recruitment pulse in 2015. The `r LastYR` spawning biomass 
relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been well below the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value fixed at 0.718.
