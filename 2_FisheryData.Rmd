#Assessment

##Data
Data used in the `r spp` assessment are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}. 
Descriptions of the data sources are in the following sections.


<!-- ************FISHERY-DEPENDENT DATA************************************ -->
###Commercial Fishery Landings
Commercial catches of California scorpionfish (often landed as “sculpin”) are available 
back to 1916. Landings from 1916 to 1935 are presented in CDFG Fish Bulletin No. 49 
and Bulletin No. 149 provides tabulated data from 1916 to 1968. Over 99% of the 
commercial catches of California scorpionfish are from south of Pt. Conception. 
Whenever possible, catches from north of Pt. Conception and also caught in Mexico 
but landed in the U.S. were excluded from the commercial catch histories. 
[California Explores the Ocean (CEO)](http://library.ucsd.edu/ceo/fishcatchtables/fish-catch-download.html)
provides landings data taken from the CDFG Fish Bulletins in electronic form, as well 
as electronic copies of all CDFG Fish Bulletins. 
 
Statewide annual commercial landings are available for California scorpionfish from 1916 to 1925,
and are assumed to be taken by hook-and-line.  Data by area and month are given in a 
series of bulletins, each bulletin usually providing information for a single year. 
Data by region and month is available for 1926 to 1986.  The Santa Barbara region 
includes San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.  Catches from this 
region were included in the catch history and comprised less than 10 mt for the 
period from 1926-1968 (the period when data at the regional scale are available). 
Catches from Mexico can be separated from the total catch starting in 1931, 
although the CDFG Bulletins do not report catches originating from Mexican 
waters available for all years, e.g., 1932-1934.  It is assumed that before 
1931 there was no catch taken from Mexican waters landed in California. 
 
The [CALCOM](http://128.114.3.187/) database was queried (March 7, 2017) for 
commercial landing estimates of California scorpionfish in California, 1969-2016.
Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, gear group, 
port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed 
samples, or assumed nominal market category).  All CALCOM California scorpionfish 
landing data are either actual port samples or the nominal California scorpionfish
market category.  However, catches in CALCOM do not separate out catches originating
from Mexican waters and landed at U.S. ports.
 
The Commercial Fisheries Information System (CFIS; maintained by CDFW) contains 
California catch in pounds by gear and port for 1969 to 2016. The CFIS 
data come from landing receipts or “fish tickets” filled out by the markets or 
fish buyers as required by the state for all commercial landings.  The fish tickets 
include the CDFW block in which the majority of the landings were caught. 
Landings reported from a block solely in Mexican waters (blocks >900) were removed from 
the catch history.  Landings with reported blocks 877-882 with area in both U.S.
and Mexican waters were retained in the catch histories.

The commercial catch is dominated by the hook-and-line fishery (89% of total catches). 
The catch by reported gear types: hook-and-line, fish pot, trawl, gill net, and 
other can be found in Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}.  Catch taken by fish pot and 
other gears is added to the hook-and-line catch in the stock assessment (30.6 mt 
total from fish pot and 93.9 mt total from other gears). 
 
In the assessment, catch for 1916 to 1968 is taken from the CDFG
Fish Bulletins. Catch by gear for 1969 to 2004 is taken from CFIS.

###Commercial Discards
Information on commercial discards from the West Coast Groundfish Observer 
Program (WCGOP) are available starting in 2004.  The commercial fishery for 
California scorpionfish has been minimal since the early 2003 (averaging 3.5 
mt per year).  The available length composition data from the observed discards is minimal, 
with 151 fish measured from 2004-2015, and less than half a metric ton.  Given the 
discard mortality of only 7%, and the small total catches in the recent years, 
discards from the commercial fleet are not considered in the assessment.

###Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data
Biological data from commercial fisheries that caught `r spp` were extracted from CALCOM 
on March 7, 2017. Samples from the hook and line fishery were available from 1999 (1 trip) 
and 2013-2015 (1 trip per year), and for 1999 (1 trip) and 2006 (2 trips) from the trawl fishery.
A total of 87 fish were measured and length compositions were based on expanded catch-weighted
landings.  The samples from 1999 for both fisheries were replaced by samples from the market
category study described below.

The CDFW conducted a market study from 1990-2004 in southern California [@Laughlin1998] to
monitor and summarize local commercial catches.  The ports sampled included San Diego, 
Santa Barbara/Ventura and Long Beach/San Pedro.  Very few of the samples from Santa 
Barbara and San Diego (four samples each from the hook-and-line and trawl fisheries 
Santa Barbara, and one sample from the hook-and-line fishery in San Diego) reported 
California scorpionfish, and are excluded from the length composition data. 
Length composition for California scorpionfish are available from the Long Beach 
samples for the hook-and-line (Table \ref{tab:ComHL_lengthsample}), gillnet 
(Table \ref{tab:ComNet_lengthsample}), and trawl fisheries (Table \ref{tab:ComTrawl_lengthsample}). 
Length samples from both groundfish (otter) trawls and single-rigged 
shrimp trawls were available from the market study.  The average size of fish from the 
otter trawls (26.5 cm) was smaller than from the shrimp trawl samples (28.1 cm).  Over 
70% of California scorpionfish catch from the trawl sector was landed from single-rigged 
shrimp trawls, which best represent the length composition of the trawl 
fleet (CALCOM).


The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart Method (Ian Stewart, personal 
communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


###Sport Fishery Removals and Discards

Data used in reconstructing the retained catch and discarded mortality for California 
scorpionfish in the California recreational fishery are from the Commercial Passenger 
Fishing Vessel (CPFV), i.e., charter or for-hire boats, logbooks (1932-2017), the Marine 
Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS, 1980-2003) and the California Recreational 
Fishery Survey (CRFS, 2004-2017). 
Total catch was accounted for including retained catch as well as the estimate of fish 
discarded dead assuming a 7% discard mortality rate approved for use in management in 
the regulatory specifications for 2009-2010 [@PFMC2008].  The MRFSS and CRFS data provide 
estimates of mortality for four recreational fishing modes: party/charter boats, 
private/rental boats, fishing from man-made structures,e.g., piers and jetties, and fishing 
from the beach or banks. 
 
The Coastal County Household Telephone Survey was used to estimate 
fishing effort for the MRFSS survey from 1980-2003 and was subject to potential 
positive avidity bias in participation by those contacted by the survey. The party/charter 
phone survey was used to estimate effort for CRFS between 2004 and 2010.  The phone survey 
participation rates were low in the area south of Pt. Conception, introducing a negative 
bias in the effort estimates. 
 
Estimates of mortality from the party/charter sector were derived from the CPFV 
logbook data from 1932-2010 and CRFS from 2011-2017.  Estimated mortality from the 
logbook data is consistent with the catch-based update conducted in 2015 as well as the 
2005 stock assessment.

An under-reporting adjustment (assuming an 80% reporting rate) was applied to the logbook data, 
which is the same as in the 2005 stock assessment was confirmed as the approximate 
level of reporting in conversation with the CRFS program director
(Connie Ryan, personal communication, CDFW).  The logbook catch was inflated by 20% 
from 1936 to 2010. Annual average weights for the party/charter boat retained catch were derived 
from the MRFSS or CRFS estimates for 1980-2010 and the 
average weight from 1980-1984 was applied to preceding years.  

To estimate discard mortality for the party/charter mode, the annual average weight was applied from lengths 
collected sampling onboard CPFVs; CRFS survey from 2004-2010.  The annual average weight 
from was applied to discards reported in CPFV logbooks from 2004-2010 and the overall 
and the average weight was applied to discards from 1995-2003.  For the period between 
1980 and 1994, the MRFSS estimates for discards were used to reflect discarding due 
to the paucity of data on the number of discards from party/charter logbooks prior to 1995. 
 
For all other modes, the MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2017) based estimates of 
retained catch and discard mortality were used.  There was a lapse in MRFSS sampling 
from 1990 through 1992, for which retained catch and discard mortality were 
estimated using the average of values three years before and three years after the 
lapse for all modes other than the party/charter mode.  For the party/charter mode, estimates of numbers 
of fish were available from logbook data and average weight from the three years 
before and after this period were applied to provide estimates for the party/charter mode. 


Estimates of retained catch and discards were not available from the non-party/charter modes 
prior to 1980, thus the ratio of catch in the party/charter mode to the other modes for 1980 
through 1985 was used to provide an estimate of catch in the other modes in the 
years 1932-1979.  In the case of the private/rental mode, a linear ramp in the ratio adjustment 
between party/charter and private/rental modes was applied between 1966 and 1979 from 0.55 in 1980 to 0.10 
in 1965, reflecting the increase in the relative proportion of catch contributed by 
the private/rental mode with time as more individuals anglers purchased vessels, as recommended 
in the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010], and the ratio of 0.10 was assumed
for all years prior.  The ratio of party/charter estimates to the man-made structure (MM) 
and beach/bank (BB) modes was assumed constant and the average between 1980 and 1989 was applied 
from 1932 to 1979.  Catch 
estimates from CPFV logbooks were not available during the World War II era from 1941
until 1946 and catch was assumed to be zero for all modes during this period.  Estimates
for retained catch and discarded mortality for 1928 to 3528 were estimated using a
linear ramp from the value for 1936 to zero in 1928 for the party/charter mode and ratios party/charter 
compared to other modes were used to proxy estimates for other modes based on the 
resulting ramped values for the party/charter mode.  The final time series of landings and discard 
mortality are in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

Biological samples from the recreational fleets are described in the sections below.

###Fishery-Dependent Indices of Abundance

**CRFS Private Boat Dockside Intercept Survey**

The CDFW provided the CRFS private boat dockside sampling fisheries data from 2004 
to 2016.  The data went through several data quality checks to identify the best 
subset of available data that are consistent over the time series and provide a 
representative relative index of abundance once standardized.  The dockside sampling 
of the private/rental mode consists of samples from a primary series 
of ports (PR1) where the majority of fishing effort for this mode originates and a 
secondary series of ports with historically low effort (PR2).  Only PR1 samples were 
used for this index as the sampling forms for the PR2 index have changed over time 
and the data could not reliably be collapsed to the trip level.  The dockside data 
consist of two types of data; Type 2 data contain records of angler-reported catch, 
i.e., catch that was not observed by the sampler and Type 3 data includes sampler-examined 
retained catch.  Of the Type 2 reported catch for scorpionfish, less than one percent 
were reported “thrown back dead” and  five percent reported as retained to eat.  Given 
that the reported retained catch is a small fraction of the catch overall and discard
mortality of California scorpionfish is low, only the Type 3 examined catch are used in the index.


The survey records the number of contributing anglers (number of anglers on the vessel 
for the private mode), but does not contain data on hours fished.  For this index, 
angler-day was the assumed effort.  The data were filtered to trips fishing with 
hook-and-line gear in southern California.  Trips with a primary fishing area of 
Mexico were also removed.  The CRFS dockside private boat records with these broad 
filters include  44,128 trips of which 3,802 caught California scorpionfish (8.6%).  


The Stephens-MacCall approach was used to identify trips with a high probability of 
catching California scorpionfish [@Stephens2004].  Prior to using the Stephens-MacCall 
approach to 
select relevant trips a number of other filters were applied to the data. 
Over the course of the time series only 45 trips 
from Santa Barbara county encountered California scorpionfish, ranging from 0-10 
trips a year.  The Stephens-MacCall approach was applied with and without trips 
from Santa Barbara and the same species were identified as indicators and 
counter-indicators.  For the final model prior to Stephens-MacCall, trips 
from Santa Barbara were excluded, leaving 41,235 trips, and 3,747 of those 
caught California scorpionfish (Table \ref{tab:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_filter}).
 
 
Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for 
species which co-occur with California scorpionfish, and negative for species that
are not caught with California scorpionfish (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_SM}). 
Potentially informative species for the Stephens-MacCall analysis were limited 
to species caught in at least one percent of all trips and caught in at least 
five years.  Some of these never occurred with California scorpionfish (strong 
‘counter-indicators’) and records with these species were removed from the data 
prior to estimation of the index. Strong counter-indicators for the CRFS private 
boat index included yellowfin tuna and dolphinfish.  

 
A total of 8,590 trips were retained following the Stephens-MacCall filter, with 3,056
all positive California scorpionfish trips retained.  The California scorpionfish
recreational fishery in the southern management area was closed for eight months 
in 2004 and nine months in 2005. The majority of records from 2004 and 2005 are 
from the period when the fishery was closed and were removed from the analysis 
(Figure \ref{fig:recregs}).  Records from months when the fishery was closed 
from 2006-2016 were also excluded from the index since this index relies on 
sampler-examined retained catch.  


Catch per unit effort was modeled using a delta-GLM approach, where the catch occurrence 
(binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the positive
catch component was modeled after log-transformation of the response variable, 
according to a normal distribution with an identity link function. The units 
for CPUE are fish landed/anglers. A gamma distribution for the positive catch
component was also explored, but model selection favored the lognormal model.
The raw CPUE of factors considered in the model by year are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_lograwCPUE}.

 
Model selection procedures selected the covariates *2-month wave* 
and *county* as important for both the catch occurrence and positive
catch component models for all data sets, along with the categorical year
factor used for the index of abundance (Table \ref{tab:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_aic}). 
The Q-Q goodness of fit plot for the lognormal portion of the model shows
a moderate fit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_QQ}).
The final index indicates a decrease in relative abundance from 2006 to 2010, 
at which point the index is relatively flat (Figure \ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_RecPR} 
and Table \ref{tab:Fleet4_RecPR_dockside_index}). 

Biological samples from trips retaining California scorpionfish were collected during
the dockside surveys.  Lengths of California scorpionfish from 1980-2016 for the private
mode were provided from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN) 
by Edward Hibsch (PSMFC) on November 29, 2016. Length measurements 
from the private mode were provided directly from CDFW for the years 2004-2016 Table
\ref{tab:Fleet4_lengthsample}.  The number of trips is the number of unique ID_CODEs 
from RecFIN for 1980-2003.  Starting in 2004 with the CRFS program,
the number of unique trips sampled in the private boat mode was recorded.  The recreational
private fleet tends to select larger fish than the recreational party/charter fleet, which
is one reason the private and party/charter fleets were maintained as two separate fleets in
the base model.  No length data for discarded fish from the recreational private mode 
fleet are available.



**CRFS CPFV Logbook Index**

CPFV operators have been required to submit written catch logs with daily trips records
of catches to CDFW since 1935.  The logbook data from 1936-1979 are available as monthly 
summaries, which do not contain the level of detail needed for an index of abundance. 
CDFW provided the CPFV logbook data from 1980-2016 (Charlene Calac, CDFW).  Logbook 
data from 1980-2016 contain records for each trip, including the fishing date, port 
of landing, vessel name and number, CDFG block area fished (Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}), 
angler effort, number of fish kept and discarded by species.  As of 1994, operators 
were required to report the number of fish discarded and lost to seals.  Prior to
1994, it is assumed that all reported fish were retained.  Details and additional 
information on the historical logbook database can be found in Hill and Schneider [-@Hill1999].
 
The number of anglers on board the vessel and the hours fished are included in 
the database for all years. Only retained fish are included in the index of abundance 
and the unit of effort is angler hours. A number of data filters were applied to 
the data to account for possible mis-reporting, e.g., trips reporting retained 
California scorpionfish in top 1% of the data (>325 fish).  Trips fishing outside 
of California scorpionfish habitat (reported as targeting pelagic species) or trips 
reporting a block with a minimum depth deeper than 140 m were also filtered out.  

Because California scorpionfish is not a primary target species, boats with fewer 
than 10 trips retaining California scorpionfish were removed from the analysis. 
Data were also filtered to only include catches reported from blocks South of Pt. 
Conception and north of the U.S.-Mexico border (Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}). 
For a block to be retained for the analysis, at least 100 trips retaining California scorpionfish and a total 
of 500 trips must have occured in the block.  A full description of the data filters is in 
Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_CPFVlogbook_filter}. A total of 432,868 trips were
retained for the index of abundance, 202,937 of which caught California scorpionfish. 
 
Two different area factors were considered for the standardization, block and region. 
The 60 retained blocks were split into nearshore regions north and south of San Pedro 
and the northern and southern islands, for four regions.  Both a delta model and a 
negative binomial model were considered for index standardization.  However, due to 
the large number of records, the traditional jackknife routine to estimate uncertainty 
for the delta model was not possible.  
 
California scorpionfish were present in 47% of all trips, and standardized
with a negative binomial model.  Factors considered were  *year*, *month*, and *area* 
(either block or region). A model with blocks and  was selected over a model 
with region by 39,180 AIC.  The final model includes *year*, *month*, and *block* 
with a log link and effort as an offset (Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_CPFVlogbook_aic}). 
The standardized index shows a cyclic pattern, with period of higher CPUE 
(late 1980’s to early 1990’s and late 1990s) and has shown a general downward 
trend since 2008 (Figure \ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_RecPC} and 
Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_CPFVlogbook_index}).  An interesting note 
is the similarity in standardized CPUE between the CPFV logbook index and the CPFV 
dockside index (not used in the stock assessment model) from 1992-1997 (for a 
Stephens-MacCall threshold of 0.1) (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_index_compare}).


**MRFSS Party/Charter Boat Dockside Index**

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of recreational 
fishing fleet. The program was temporarily suspended 
from 1990-1992 due to lack of funding. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time
series was truncated at 1998 due to sampling overlap with the onboard observer program (i.e., 
the same observer samples the catch while onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside 
intercept survey for the same vessel). Each entry in the RecFIN 
Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular 
survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also 
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers 
being interviewed.  The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. 
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records 
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”)

Initial trip filters included eliminating trips targeting species caught near the 
surface waters for all or part of the 
trip, including trips with catch of bluefin tuna, 
yellowfin tuna, dorado, Pacific bonito, skipjack, albacore,
chinook salmon, coho salmon and bigeye tuna. Trips with catch of yellowtail 
amberjack were also removed since effort on such trips can often be focused in the surface
and mid-water where California scorpionfish do not occur. In addition, trips with aggregate
effort below and above 95% percentile (less than 2 and over 109.5 hours) were removed 
to exclude trips for which either too little effort was exerted to be informative or longer
trips that may make an excessive contribution to the effort likely distributed over a 
number of target species, only some of which may co-occur with California scorpionfish. 
Trips in Santa Barbara County were removed due the low number of positive trips retaining   
California scorpionfish.

Since recreational fishing trips target a wide variety of species, standardization
of the catch rates requires selecting trips that are likely to have fished in habitats 
containing California scorpionfish. The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens2004] filtering approach was used
to identify trips with a high probability of catching California scorpionfish, based 
on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. Prior to applying the 
Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative predictor species, 
i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (at least 30 positive
trips total, distributed across at least 10 years of the index) to inform the binomial
model. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species which co-occur with California scorpionfish, and negative for species that 
are not caught with California scorpionfish. Each of these filtering steps and the resulting 
number of trips remaining in the sampling 
frame are provided in Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_filter}.


Prior to the Stephens-MacCall filter, a total of 3,968 trips were retained for the analysis. 
Species that composed less than 5% 
of the catch were excluded from analysis, which included Chub mackerel, Pacific 
mackerel and barracuda.  As expected, positive
indicators of California scorpionfish trips include several species of nearshore rockfish,
California sheephead, California halibut, Pacific sanddabs and seabasses and counter-indicators
include several species of deep-water rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet5_RecPC_docksideSM}). 
While the filter is useful 
in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted 
in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one target species can result
in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. 
 
Two levels of filtering were applied using the Stephens-MacCall filter.  The Stephens-MacCall
filtering method identified the probability of occurrence (in this case 0.27) at which 
the rate of "false positives" equals "false negatives."
The trips selected using this criteria were compared to an 
alternative method including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability 
of encountering a California scorpionfish.  This assumes that if California scorpionfish
were caught, the vessel must have fished in appropriate habitat during the trip. 
In addition, the false positives from a lower probability of occurrence 
(0.10) was considered to reflect a less stringent threshold inclusive of more 
trips including a higher proportion of the false positive trips combined with the 
positive trips from the entire data set was evaluated for comparison.   
 
Catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) was modelled using a delta model 
[@Lo1992; @Stefansson1996]. Model selection using Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) supported inclusion of year and
region effects in both the binomial and lognormal components of the index for both 
the model with false positives using the 0.27 threshold and the 0.10 threshold.  The addition 
of month effects (to allow for seasonal changes in CPUE) did not improve model fit in the 
lognormal model, but the full model including month, year and county was supported for the 
binomial model (Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_aic}).  The difference in AIC values 
for the full model compared to the 
model with only year and county was greater for the binomial model (201.5) favoring the 
full modal compared to the small difference for the lognormal model favoring the model 
with only year and county (8.3). As a result, the full model including year, county and 
month effects was selected for further analysis.  
 
The resulting index values for 1989 were anomalously high compared to other years. 
In addition, the less stringent filter of 0.1 resulted in a higher index value than 
0.27, which was contrary to the expectation that including trips with fewer 
positive trips would decrease the CPUE.  Further examination of the number of 
California scorpionfish per trip by year showed a lower number of trips for this
year than others and a lower proportion of low catch trips explaining why exclusion 
of low catch trips through application of the 0.27 index reduced the relative 
magnitude of the 1989 index value relative to other years.  As a result of this
anomalous result and the low sample size, trips from 1989 were excluded from analysis.  


The percentage of trips that retained California scorpionfish was 20.8% (828/3,968) prior
to filtering with the Stephens-MacCall method, and 71.0% (828/,1167) with the filter set 
to 0.27 and 26.7% (828/3,099) with the filter set to 0.10, filtered data set. 
Residual-based model diagnostics for the positive component of the index suggest
the data generally met the assumptions of the GLM (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet5_RecPC_docksideQQ}). 
The resulting index is highly variable for both thresholds,
with consistent peaks in 1984 and 1998 (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_index_compare}). 
Application of the 0.27 threshold holds the potential of biasing the resulting index values 
high by excluding false positive trips while including positive trips with equivalent probability 
of encountering California scorpionfish.  The 0.1 threshold removes a high proportion of trips 
with shelf rockfish species indicative of effort exerted in deeper depths than are commonly 
occupied by California scorpionfish, while retaining false positive trips with equivalent 
probabilities of capture to true positives and thus was retained for further analysis. 
The resulting jackknifed mean index values, standard error, coefficient of variation 
and confidence intervals for the 0.1 threshold model, excluding 1989, with year, 
month and county effects are provided in Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_aic}.
 
The results of the models with each of the thresholds provided similar trends 
seen in Figure \ref{fig:Fleet5_RecPC_dockside_index_compare} along 
with the results from the CPFV logbook index.  The trends
differ from those resulting from the CPFV logbook index early in the time series,
but both show an increase in the mid to late 1990s.  The PC dockside index was
excluded from further analysis in the model given that the CPFV logbook index 
represents the same sector of the fishery and presumably contains data from the
some of the same trips, utilizes data for many thousands more trips, and 
provides data from 1989 to 1992 omitted from the MRFSS data as a result of 
filtering out 1989 and a lapse of sampling from 1990-1992.

_Party/Charter Dockside Length Measurements_

The retained catch for the recreational party/charter mode has been measured
during the dockside interviews since 1980, and also by two different onboard 
observer programs in southern California by Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] 
a combination of unpublished data and a study by Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] from
1984-1989 (Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_lengthsample}). The length measurements from
Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] are assumed to all be from retained fish. 
 
 
Length measurements for California scorpionfish from 1980-2016 were provided
from RecFIN by Edward Hibsch (PSMFC) on November 29, 2016. The number of trips 
from 1980-2003 is the number of trips with observer catch of 
California scorpionfish as outlined in the Supplemental Material ("Identifying Trips
in RecFIN").  However, the algorithm used to determine the number of trips has
not been applied to RecFIN data past 2003.  The number of trips for 2004 and 2005,
was taken as the ratio of the number of interviews (ID_CODE) in RecFIN to the number 
of known trips for years with complete data.  The number of individual ID_CODEs 
was reduced by 38% for 2004 and 2005, and gives reasonable sample sizes. 
From 2004-2016 the number of trips from which the samples were taken is known.  

From 1985-1987 Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] conducted an onboard observer program 
in southern California, and measured both retained and discarded fish.  Additional 
unpublished years (1984, 1988-1999) from this onboard observer sampling program 
were provided by CDFW (Paulo Serpa).  From 1984-1989, the onboard observer program 
measured 11,892 retained California scorpionfish compared to the 1,981 measurements 
in RecFIN.  It is almost certain, but cannot be verified, that some of the lengths 
from the onboard observer program were input in RecFIN.  Therefore, the onboard 
observer measurements from 1984-1989 are used instead of those from RecFIN for these
years.

**Onboard Observer Party/Charter Boat**

California implemented a statewide Onboard Observer Sampling Program in 1999, and 
began measuring discarded fish in 2003 [@Monk2014].  The goal of the Onboard Observer 
Sampling Program is to collect data including charter boat fishing locations, catch 
and discard of observed fish by species, and lengths of discarded fish.  The program 
samples the CPFV fleet, i.e., charter boats or for-hire 
boats, and collects drift-specific information at each fishing stop on an observed trip. 
At each fishing stop recorded information includes start and end times, start and end 
location (latitude/longitude), start and end depth, number of observed anglers (a subset 
of the total anglers), and the catch (retained and discarded) by species of the observed anglers.
 
CDFW implemented a regulation of three hooks in 2000, which was reduced to (and remains 
at) two hooks in 2001. CDFW also implemented a 10 inch size limit for California 
scorpionfish in 2000.  Prior to 2001, 
there were no depth restrictions for the southern California recreational fishery. 
Given these regulation changes, the data from 1999 and 2000 are excluded from the index. 
 
From 2002 to 2005, the California scorpionfish fishery was closed from four to nine 
months of the year.  During these years, California scorpionfish were still encountered, 
but all discarded.  The onboard observer program provides the only available information 
on discards because the sampler records both the retained and discarded catch at each 
fishing stop.  The onboard observer data are used to create two indices of abundance, 
one using only the discarded catch and one using only the retained catch.  The index of 
discarded catch is used as an index of abundance for the recreational discard fleet, 
and the index derived from the retained catch is treated a survey in the assessment model.  

The entire dataset was filtered as one, regardless of retained or discarded, due to the 
fact that discarding can occur for a number of reasons, e.g., angler preference, size
limit, bag limit, etc., and California scorpionfish are often retained and discarded on
the same fishing drift. 

Prior to any analyses, drifts with erroneous or missing data were removed from the data 
considered for the California scorpionfish index.  The locations of positive encounters 
(retained + discarded) were mapped, using the drift starting locations.  Regions of 
suitable habitat were defined by creating detailed hulls (similar to an alpha hull) 
with a 0.01 decimal degree buffer around a location or cluster of locations. 
Any portion of a region that intersected with land was removed.  Drifts that did not 
intersect with one of these areas were considered structural zeroes, i.e., outside of 
the species habitat, and not used in analyses.  

Five areas were retained based on sample sizes, 1) nearshore area from the U.S./Mexico 
border to Oceanside, 2) nearshore Oceanside to Newport Beach, 3) Newport Beach to 
Palos Verdes, 4) Palos Verdes to Point Magu, and 4) drifts from Santa Cruz Island, Santa 
Barbara and Anacapa Islands, Santa Catalina Island, and San Clemente Islands were 
combined.  Drifts encountering California scorpionfish north of Point Magu were rare 
(<5% positive encounters).

Drift locations within the Cowcod Conservation Area (CCA) or in Mexican waters were 
also filtered out of the dataset.  The years 1999 and 2000 were removed from the 
index due to changes in hook and gear regulations during those years.  California 
adopted a 3-hook and 1-line regulation in 2000, which changed to 2-hooks and 
1-line in 2001. California scorpionfish is not a common target species for the 
CPFV fleet, but if often a fallback species, for trips targeting seabass 
or rockfish.  California scorpionfish are targeted more often in January and February 
when the rockfish/cabezon/greenling complex is closed.  Boat identifiers were available 
for all trips in the onboard observer database.  Approximately 1,000 drifts were filtered 
out after accounting for boats that were identified as not encountering scorpionfish 
(Table \ref{tab:Fleet6_RecDD_onboard_filter}).  A total of 26,733 drifts for the analysis 
were retained.  Of these, 5,507 encountered scorpionfish, with 3,249 
discarding California scorpionfish and 3,867 retaining California scorpionfish.

The drift-level effort cannot be parsed out between the retained and discarded catch. 
The effort represents the total angler hours fished by the subset of observed anglers 
for a particular drift, and is the same for both the discard-only and retained-only 
indices. Both of the indices derived from this dataset were standardized using a 
delta modeling approach [@Lo1992]. 

_Onboard Observer Discarded Catch Index_

Covariates considered in the full model included *year*, *area* (5 levels), *month* 
(12 levels), and *20 m depth bins* (5 levels). All covariates were specified as categorical 
variables. A lognormal model for the positives was selected by AIC over a gamma model 
(delta-AIC of 482.28). Model selection for both the lognormal and binomial models retained 
all covariates (Table \ref{tab:Fleet6_RecDD_onboard_aic}).  The Q-Q plot for the positive 
catch lognormal model looks reasonable (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet6_RecDD_QQ}).  The final 
index shows a lower CPUE of the discards in 2001 and an increase from 2002-2005 when 
the California scorpionfish recreational fishery was
restricted by depth or closed (Table \ref{tab:Fleet6_RecDD_onboard_index} and Figure 
\ref{fig:Fleet6_index4_logcpuedata_RecDD}).  The relative CPUE of the discards decreases from 
2006 to 2015.

_Discarded Catch Length Composition_

As of 2003, Onboard Observer program has taken length measurements for discarded fish. 
The retained catch is measured during the dockside (angler intercept) surveys, 
and cannot necessarily be matched to a trip with the discard lengths prior to 2012. 
Additional discarded length measurements were available from both CDFW unpublished 
data (1984, 1988-1989) and the Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] onboard observer program from 
1985-1987.  The sample sizes of measured discarded fish in the 1980s is small.  The mean 
length of discarded fish is smaller than for years when the length restriction was in 
place (Table \ref{tab:Fleet6_lengthsample} and Figure \ref{fig:Fleet6_comp_lendat_bubflt6mkt2}).

The discard length composition reflects the California scorpionfish seasonal closures 
from 2002-2005. Anglers encountered and discarded fish greater than the size limit of
10 inches during these years.  When the fishery is open, anglers are most often only
discarded California scorpionfish that are smaller than the legal size.  This also 
holds true for the length composition of discarded California scorpionfish in the 
1980s before there was a size limit.


_Onboard Observer Retained Catch Index_

The index of relative abundance using the retained-only catch from the onboard observer 
program is a separate survey fleet in the base model and has no lengths associated with 
it. Covariates considered in the full model included *year*, *area* (5 levels), *month* 
(12 levels), and *20 m depth bins* (5 levels). All covariates were specified as 
categorical variables. A lognormal model was selected by AIC 
over a gamma model for the positives (delta-AIC of 534.9).Model selection for both the 
lognormal and binomial models retained all covariates (Table \ref{tab:Fleet12_RecPC_onboard_aic}). 
The Q-Q plot for the positive catch lognormal model looks reasonable 
(Figure \ref{fig:Fleet12_RecPCOBR_QQ}).  The final index shows a lower CPUE 
of the retained catch from 2002 and 2003 (Table \ref{tab:Fleet12_RecPC_onboard_index} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Fleet12_index4_logcpuedata_RecPCOBR}).  The relative CPUE 
of the retained catch shows a decline from 2007-2015, and an increase in 2016.


<!-- ************FISHERY-INDPENDENT DATA*********************************** -->

###Fishery-Independent Data Sources

**Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) Monitoring Trawl Survey**

Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs; referred to the sanitation index in the stock assessment 
model and associated plots) that discharge into coastal waters are required to conduct 
trawl surveys to monitor the demersal fish community in the vicinity of the discharge sites 
as a condition of the 
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, issued 
by the Environmental Protection Agency if the discharge is to federal waters, and the State Water 
Resources Control Board if discharge is into state waters. All POTWs holding NPDES permits 
in southern California were contacted for trawl data. 
The two northernmost districts, Goleta and the City of Oxnard, provided data (via Aquatic 
Bioassay & Consulting Laboratories, Inc.), but California scorpionfish have not been 
encountered in either district's trawl surveys.  The four other 
POTWs, Orange County, The City of Los Angeles Environmental Monitoring 
Division (CLAEMD), Los Angeles County, 
and the City of San Diego Public Utilities Department all encounter California scorpionfish 
and provided trawl 
data (Figures \ref{fig:Fleet7_sanitation_map2} and \ref{fig:Fleet7_sanitation_map1}).


All of the POTWs sample using the same protocols and gear as the Southern California Bight 
Regional Monitoring Program. The trawl net is a 7.6 m wide Marinovich, semi-balloon 
otter trawl (2.54 cm mesh) with a 0.64 cm mesh cod-end liner.

A description of the data provided by each POTW is provided. In 
contrast to the inverse variance weighted index from the 2005 assessment, trawls from all
POTWs were combined to develop a single index of abundance. 

_Orange County_.

The Orange County Sanitation District provided trawl data from 1970-2015 (Jeff Armstrong,
Orange County Sanitation District).  Fixed stations are sampled either annually (summer) or 
semi-annually in the winter 
and summer, Quarters 1 and 3 (Jan-March and July-September).  From 1970-1985 Quarter 
2, trawl effort was based on a 10 minute tow time.  As of 1985 
Quarter 3, trawls were towed a distance of 450 m. Tow time was not available
for approximately half of the tows from 1985 Quarter 3 to 2016, and was imputed
based on the mean tow time of the sampling station. 

Eleven stations (T0-T6,T10-T13) sampled in at least 11 years and with California scorpionfish 
present in at least 5% of trawls were retained for the analysis (1,490 trawls). 
For hauls with fewer than 30 California scorpionfish, each fish was measured to the nearest 
mm (standard length).  In hauls with more than 30 California scorpionfish, they were tallied 
by size class (nearest cm).  Six hauls, all from station T3, caught more than 30 California 
scorpionfish.  From these six hauls, 30 California scorpionfish were measured to the nearest mm, 
and the remainder were binned to cm size classes.
 
 
_The City of Los Angeles Environmental Monitoring Division (CLAEMD)_.

The CLAEMD provided trawl data from 1986-2016 (Craig Campbell,
Lost Angeles City).  The CLAEMD follows the same sampling protocols as the 
Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program trawl survey.  Stations within Los 
Angeles Harbor were excluded from the dataset. Years with fewer than ten total hauls
were removed from the analysis (1986, 1987, and 1992), as were station sampled in fewer than 
 10 years. Ten stations (A1, A3, C1, C3, C6, C9A, D1T, Z2, Z3, Z4), total 921 hauls, were retained
 for the index of abundance.
 
Tow times were recorded starting in 1999, and assumed to be 10 minutes prior to 1999. Haul depth
was missing for approximately half of the hauls, and was imputed as the mean depth
of other hauls at that station. All California scorpionfish encountered were measured to 
the nearest cm (standard length).
 
_Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County_.

The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County provided quarterly trawl data from 1972-2016 
(Shelly Walther, Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County) and follow the same sampling 
protocols as the 
Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program. Trawl survey 
stations sampled in fewer than 10 years or at 305 m where California
scorpionfish were never observed were removed from the analysis.  Non-standard and 
special study trawls were also removed, e.g., night trawl study in 1987. 
Hauls were based on a 10 minute tow time and that is assumed as the effort for all hauls. 
Twelve stations (stations at 23 m, 61 m, and 137 m for T0, T1, T4, and T5), totaling 
1,848 hauls were retained after initial filtering.  All California scorpionfish encountered
 were measured to the nearest cm (standard length).
 
_City of San Diego Ocean Monitoring Program_.

The City of San Diego's Ocean Monitoring Program is conducted by Environmental Monitoring 
& Technical Services Division of the Public Utilities Department (City of San Diego 
Public Utilities Department). The City of San Diego holds three NPDES that 
require monitoring of the areas potentially impacted by the discharge of wastewater into the Pacific Ocean 
via the Point Loma Ocean Outfall and South Bay Ocean Outfall (Timothy Stebbins, personal communication, 
City of San Diego Public Utilities Department). One permit is for the City’s Point Loma 
Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge via the Point Loma Ocean Outfall. A second permit is for discharge 
via the South Bay Ocean Outfall from the City’s South Bay Water Reclamation Plant. The third permit is 
also for discharge via the South Bay Ocean Outfall, but from the South Bay International Wastewater 
Treatment Plant operated by the U.S. Section of the International Boundary & Water Commission (USIBWC). 
Effluent from the two South Bay treatment facilities commingle before discharge to the ocean, so a single 
monitoring program is conducted by the City and USIBWC to meet those requirements (i.e., the City conducts 
the joint program under contract to the USIBWC).  For purposes of this assessment, any trawls conducted in 
Mexican water, were excluded from analyses.
 
The City of San Diego Public Utilities Department provided trawl data from 1985-2015 
(Ami Latker and Robin Gartman, City of San Diego Public Utilities Department) 
and follow the same sampling protocols as the Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program.
Stations sampled in fewer than 15 years were filtered from the dataset. Fourteen stations from the Point 
Loma Ocean Outfall (SD1-SD14) and five stations from the South Bay Ocean Outfall were retained (SD17-21), 
totaling 1,180 hauls. A tow time of 10 minutes is assumed for all trawls.  All California scorpionfish 
encountered were measured to the nearest cm (standard length).

_POTWs Index Standardization_

Trawls from all POTWs were combined to standardize the index of 
relative abundance.  This is in contrast to the 2005 assessment that standardized 
each of the POTWs indices independently and combined them using an 
inverse variance weighting approach [@Maunder2005].  One reason for this was that the 2005 
base model going into the STAR panel was five sub-models for the southern California Bight. 
Taking into consideration that the 2017 base model is a one-area model, all of the POTWs 
follow the same sampling protocols and the sampling 
design is a fixed station approach, the decision was made to develop a single index.  The 
index was standardized using a delta-GLM approach.

The data were filtered for each POTW independently.  The filters applied are 
described in the sections above and summarized in Table \ref{tab:Fleet7_Sanitation_filter}. 
The covariates considered for the lognormal and binomial models were *year* (47 levels), 
*quarter* (4 levels), and *station* (52 levels).  A lognormal model for the positives was 
select over a gamma model by a delta AIC of 619.  AIC model select was used for both the 
lognormal and binomial models and all three covariates were selected for both (Table 
\ref{tab:Fleet7_Sanitation_aic}).   The standardized index shows a large spike in relative 
CPUE in 1981, varies within a range of 0.1 to 0.25 from 1989 to 2009, and then declines 
until 2013 (Figure \ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_Sanitation}).  The last three years of the index 
show an increase in relative abundance.  The final standardized index and log-standard error can be 
found in Table \ref{tab:Fleet7_Sanitation_index}.  We did explore standardizing the indices 
independently.  However, this results in a loss of data, as some POTWs had 
low sample sizes in some years.  The general trend in relative CPUE is similar across POTWs (Figures \ref{fig:Fleet7_Sanitation_indexcompare}). 

_POTWs Length Composition_

Each district measures every fish encountered in their survey.  Orange County Sanitation 
District was the only program sampling in 1970 and 1971 and encountered a small number 
of California scorpionfish in those years (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet7_Sanitation_lengthbydistrict}).
Los Angeles County has encountered pulses of large numbers of California scorpionfish in 2002, 
2004 and 2005.  Figure \ref{fig:Fleet7_Sanitation_lengthboxplots} shows the distribution of 
lengths for California scorpionfish by 25 m depth bins and POTW. The median length 
of fish from the CLAEMD trawls is smaller than the other two POTWs. However, there are 
only 120 fish encountered in that depth range, compared to 1,372 fish encountered in 
the 50-74 m depth range (Table \ref{tab:Fleet7_lengthdepth}).
  
The length composition indicates a fairly consistent size range of fish encountered 
in the trawl surveys, with a handful of smaller fish in 2016 
(Figure \ref{fig:Fleet7_comp_lendat_bubflt10mkt2}).  Length measurements from all 5,525 hauls 
of the POTWs were combined across POTWs.  The number of California 
scorpionfish was lowest during the first few years of the time series, and also declines starting
 in 2012 (Table \ref{tab:Fleet7_lengthsample}).

**NWFSC Trawl Survey Index**

The Northwest Fishery Science Center has conducted combined shelf and slope trawl 
surveys (hereafter referred as NWFSC trawl survey) since 2003, based on a random-grid 
design from depths of 55 to 1280 meters.  Additional details on this survey and design
are available in the abundance and distribution reports by Keller et al. [-@Keller2008]. 
The haul locations and raw catch rates (in log scale) are shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_posdepth}.

The proportions of positive catch haul and the raw catch rates of positive hauls by 
depth and latitude are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_posdepth} and 
Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_poslat}, respectively.  These figures show that more 
scorpionfish were caught at shallow depth zones and in the southern latitude zones. 
Box plots of length summary data by depth and sex (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_lengthlat}) 
and by latitude and sex (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_lengthlat}) show no evidences of 
different spatial distributions (by depth and latitude) by length or by sex.  
The numbers of total hauls and percentages of positive catch hauls by depth and 
latitude zones are presented in Tables \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_catchdepth} and
\ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_catchlat}, respectively.  Summaries of raw catch data by 
year are listed in Table \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_summary}.  Overall, catches of scorpionfish
by the survey were very low with less than 1mt fish caught during the entire 14 
years of the survey.  Bubble plots of length frequency distribution by year and 
sex are presented in Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_comp_lendat_bubflt8mkt0}.

Summaries of age data by year and sex are presented in Table \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_agesummary}. 
There were more males (n = 529) aged than females (n = 340), presumably 
indicating that there are more males than females in the area surveyed.  The table 
also shows that mean ages and mean lengths for both sexes decreased in recent years. 
Table \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_agepercents} show five percentiles of fish aged by sex, 
indicating more older males in the population.  All aged data from the survey were 
used as conditional age-at-length matrix in the assessment model.  The mean age-at-length
indicates males and females to have similar growth patterns until around age three, at which
time, females are larger than males (Table \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_meanAatL}).

Total biomass estimates from the survey were analyzed using the VAST program 
[@Thorson2017].  The Q-Q goodness of fit plot, maps of the Pearson residuals for encounter 
probability and positive catch rates, and time series of 
total biomass estimates are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCtrawl_QQ}, 
\ref{fig:Fleet8_encounter_pearson}, \ref{fig:Fleet8_catchrate_pearson}, and
\ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_NWFSCtrawl}, respectively.  The Q-Q plots shows generally good 
fits and the time series of biomass estimates indicates no significant trend with 
relatively large uncertainties from the survey.  The final survey index and log 
standard error used in the assessment model are in Table \ref{tab:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_index}.


**CSUN/VRG Gillnet Survey Index**

California State University Northridge with Vantuna Research Group (CSUN/VRG) conducted 
a gillnet survey from 1995-2008 (Daniel Pondella, VRG).  Sites along the coast from Santa Barbara to Newport 
were consistently sampled for the time series, as well as Catalina Island. 
Gillnet sets from within Marina Del Rey and Catalina Harbor were
removed from the analysis.
  
All gillnets were the same length with six-25' panels (150' in length). 
The standard sampling gillnet had 1", 1.5", 2 square mesh, with each mesh on two panels. 
Samples were excluded if they were collected using a net other than the standard sampling gear.
Other data filters included remove months that were not consistently sampled (Table 
\ref{tab:Fleet9_GillnetSurvey_filter}).

Five covariates were considered in the model standardization, *year* (14 levels), 
*month* (8 levels), *site* (8 levels indicating the sampling site location), *float* 
(2 levels indicate if floats were used on the gillnet), 
and *perp/para* (2 levels indicate if the net was set perpendicular or parallel to 
shore). A lognormal was select over a gamma model for the positive encounters by a 
delta AIC of 108.29.  Covariates selected via AIC for both the lognormal and binomial 
models included *year*, *site*, and *perp/para* (Table \ref{tab:Fleet9_GillnetSurvey_aic},
Figure \ref{fig:Fleet9_GillnetSurvey_QQ}).  The standardized index decreases from 
1995-1998 and remains flat until through the early 2000's with three high years at the 
end of the time series (Figure \ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_GillnetSurvey}).  

The survey measured (standard length) every California scorpionfish encountered, totaling 
1,130 fish. The majority of fish encountered were between 14 and 33 cm total length, with no 
strong trends or patterns in age classes during the time period 
(Figure \ref{fig:Fleet9_GillnetSurvey_lendat_bubflt10mkt2})




**Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Project Trawl Survey**

The southern California Coast Water Research Project [SCCWRP](http://www.sccwrp.org/Homepage.aspx) 
works to bring together over 60 agencies in southern California, including all of the aforementioned 
POTWs, that conduct monitoring of aquatic 
environments. One of the monitoring programs in the Southern California Bight (SCB)
is a trawl survey conducted every five years.  The pilot year of the survey was 1994.
Data from each of the survey years (1994, 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013) were provided by 
the SCCWRP (Shelly Moore, SCCWRP).

In each of the five years of the study, sampling stations were chosen via a stratified 
random sampling design [@Bight1998] (Figure \ref{Fleet11_SCBSurvey_map}).  All participating agencies follow the same protocols 
(net is towed 10 minutes at a speed of 1.0 m/sec) and use the same net (semiballoon 
otter trawl).  All fish and invertebrates are identified, counted, batch-weighed, and 
measured (standard length to the nearest cm).

A series of data filters were applied to the dataset (Table \ref{tab:Fleet11_SCBSurvey_filter}). 
Only two scorpionfish were encountered 
in hauls deeper than 450 m.  Ninety-five percent of the data were retained for 
hauls in shallower than 97 m, which was set as a filter.  Stations in harbors 
(2/114 positive hauls), north of Ventura (6/190 positive hauls) and the islands 
(16/117 positive hauls) were excluded due to low encounters of California scorpionfish. 
The final dataset included 398 hauls, 129 of which encountered California scorpionfish. 
The unit of effort for this survey is in kg per tow time (minutes).

Covariates considered for the delta-GLM model were *year* (5 levels), 
*area* (4 regions), and *month* (3 levels; July-September).  Sampling stations were 
assigned to one of four regions, 1) Ventura to Long Beach, 2) Long Beach to Dana Point, 
3) Dana Point to San Diego, and 4) San Diego to the U.S./Mexico Border.  A lognormal 
model was selected over a gamma model for the positives by a delta AIC of 30. Depth 
(20-m depth bins) were considered, but none of the levels were significant in a full 
lognormal or binomial model and was not considered further.   AIC selection 
for both the lognormal and binomial models selected all covariates for the final model 
(Table \ref{tab:Fleet11_SCBSurvey_aic}).  The Q-Q plot used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit 
of the lognormal portion of the model is in Figures \ref{fig:Fleet11_SCBsurvey_QQ}.

The standardized index of abundance indicates higher relative CPUE in 1994 and 2003, 
with the other three years lower (Figure \ref{fig:index4_logcpuedata_SCBSurvey}).  The 
fact that the survey is conducted every five years (4 years between the pilot and 
the 1998 survey), may preclude drawing any firm conclusions on trends in abundance 
from this data.  

The survey measured a total of 427 fish, with the last two years of the survey 
(2008 and 2013) only encountering 25 and 53 California scorpionfish, respectively. 
However, the smallest fish observed in this survey were in 2013 (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet11_SCBsurvey_lendat_bubflt11mkt2}).


*Generating Station Impingement Surveys*

Data from the southern California generating station surveys were provided by 
Eric Miller (MBC Applied Environmental Sciences). The generating stations
all draw in seawater through an intake system 
for once-through cooling water.  There are five generating stations that conduct normal operation
and heat treatment surveys with observations of California scorpionfish: 
Scattergood Generating Station (SGS), El Segundo Generating
Station (ESGS), Redondo Beach Generating Station (RBGS), Huntington Beach Generating Station
(HBGS), and San Onofre Generation Station (SONGS). Each generating station draws in water from 
different depths and distances
from shore: SGS draws from 500 m offshore at 6 m depth, ESBS draws from 700 m offshore at 
9.8 m depth, RBGS draws from 289 m offshore at 13.7 m depth, HBGS draws from 500 m offshore
at 5 m depth, and SONGS has two intake systems 960 m and 900 m offshore and at 9 m and 8 m 
depth, respectively [@Miller2009].  

The two surveys conducted are normal operations surveys and heat treatment surveys.  For 
normal operations surveys, the intake screens are rotated and cleaned to start the survey.
All of the impinged fish are washed off the screen at this time and discarded. When the
intake screens stop running, the survey begins. The generating station then operates as 
normal for 24 hours, which includes operating and washing the screens as usual 
(typically every eight hours). The screens are then operated and washed again after
a second 24 hours has elapsed.  Any specimens washed off the screens during the
48 hour study period are retained. The total sample is processed to identify, 
count, weigh, and measure the fish and macroinvertebrates. 
There is often no information on the water flow collected during the 48 hour period of 
the normal operations survey.  Most fish enter the generating station and swim 
in the sedimentation basin until either getting exhausted or impinged.  The SONGS
generating station also has a fish elevator that releases a fraction of the fish
back to the ocean.

At each generating station, cooling water, i.e., seawater, is pumped into the 
generating station where it reaches a sedimentation basin.  Water flow is one-directional,
and fish can reside in this area, but not escape.  During a heat treatment, water in the 
sedimentation basin is heated to over 38 degrees Celsius, killing all fish and invertebrates,
and impinging them on the travelling screens.  

The screens are operated and washed off per normal operating procedures right up until 
the heat treatment takes place.  Therefore, only the fish remaining in the sedimentation
basin and those impinged since the last screen rotation are counted in the heat treatment 
survey. The total flow between heat treatments has previously been used to standardize indices
in previous reports. However, this is not representative of the flow relating to fish impinged
during the heat treatment.  The water flows vary widely among heat treatments, time of year (higher in 
summer when energy demands increase), and generating stations.  Therefore, the generating station impingement
surveys were not used to develop indices of abundance.  However, length composition data from the impingement
surveys were used.

The length composition data from the impingement show a higher proportion of smaller (<10 cm) fish
since 2012 (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet10_comp_lendat_bubflt10mkt2})


*California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Survey*
UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography, CDFG, and the National Marine Fisheries Service 
have carried out a plankton survey on a regular basis since 1951 [@Moser1993]. 
Prior to 1965, \emph{Scorpaena} samples were not speciated.

California scorpionfish larvae encounters from CalCOFI surveys were provided by 
Noelle Bowlin (NMFS SWFSC). Only 16 positive bongo tows in the core area (lines 77-93) 
encountered California scorpionfish.
The majority of the 335 positive bongo tows occurred in Mexico, south of Punta Eugenia 
Baja California and are likely a combination of California scorpionfish and other
\emph{Scorpaena} species. The California scorpionfish egg masses are encountered
in the CalCOFI surveys, but because California scorpionfish is not a target species
they are entered in the database as "unidentified eggs" (William Watson, NMFS SWFSC). 
An index of abundance was not developed for the CalCOFI data due to the small
sample sizes.
