#Research Needs
There are a number of areas of research that could improve the stock 
assessment for California scorpionfish.  Below are issues identified by the STAT team:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Natural mortality}: Both female natural mortality and steepness were 
fixed in the base model.  The collection of age data for older females may improve 
the ability to estimate female natural mortality in the model.  The NWFSC trawl survey
was the only available source of age data for this assessment, of which there were a 
number of age-1 fish and the data were dominated by males.

\item \textbf{Steepness}: California scorpionfish has not been fished to a level where information 
on steepness is available.  A meta-analysis for species with similar breeding strategies to 
California scorpionfish could be conducted if data are available.

\item \textbf{Stock in Mexico}:  No available information on the status of California 
scorpionfish in Mexico could be found.  A number of emails were sent to researchers 
in Mexico and none were returned.  It is known that a portion of the stock resides 
in Mexico and that boat leaving from San Diego target California scorpionfish off 
the Coronado Islands.  

\item \textbf{Sex ratio}:  The sex ratio in both Love et al. [@Love1987] and samples 
from the NWFSC trawl survey were skewed towards males. Data on sex ratios from the 
recreational or commercial fisheries would help in determining the sex ratio of the population.

\item \textbf{Aggregating behavior}: Little is known about the aggregating behavior
of California scorpionfish.  California scorpionfish are known to aggregate in both
the spawning and non-spawning seasons.  The location and timing of the aggregations
would aid in modelling the high catch events.

\item \textbf{Fecundity/Maturity}: There are currently no estimates of fecundity for California 
scorpionfish.  Love et al. [@Love1987] has published the only estiamtes of maturity for California 
scorpionfish, but the original copies of the data are no long available.  Some data on the spatial distribution of the eggs are available from CalCOFI, but were not keypunched to the species level. 
California scorpionfish mature at a young age, and additional data can help inform the maturity 
ogive.
