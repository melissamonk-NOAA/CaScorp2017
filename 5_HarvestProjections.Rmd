#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the final base model.
The total catches in 2017 and 2018 are set to the PFMC adopted California scorpionfish 
ACLs (Table \ref{tab:tab:mnmgt_perform).  CDFW allocated 75% of the ACL to the recreational 
fisheries and 25% to the commercial fisheries.  The catches were divided among the fleets
within each the commercial and recreational fisheries by taking the ratio of the average 
catches from 2012-2016. The average of 2012-2016 catch by fleet was used to distribute 
catches in forecasted years.  The research catch harvest guideline for 2017-2018 was 
set at 0.2 mt.  The average research catch from the NWFSC trawl survey averaged 0.077 
mt from 2012-2016, which was used in the forecast.
