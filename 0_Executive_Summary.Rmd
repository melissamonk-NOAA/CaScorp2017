#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) resource 
in U.S. waters off the coast of southern California (south of Pt. Conception) using data 
through `r LastYR`. `r spp` are most abundant in the southern California Bight and their 
range extends to Punta Eugena, Mexico, about halfway down the Baja peninsula.  Catches 
from Mexico were not included in this assessment, and catches from Mexican waters that 
were landed in the U.S. were excluded from the catch histories.


##Catches{-}
Information on historical landings of `r spp` are available back to 1916, with the 
assumption that from 1916 to 1968 all of the commercial landings were caught by 
hook-and-line (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}).  Commercial landings were small during 
the years of World War II, ranging between `r min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1939 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 1945,2],0))` to `r max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1939 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 1945,2],0))` metric  tons (mt) per year.
The recreational fleets began ramping up in the 1960s and have dominated the catch since then
(Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1}-\ref{fig:Exec_catch2}).  The party/charter fleet has been 
the major component of the recreational sector since the early 2000s.

The catches from the commercial fleets has been small in the last decade, range from 1.19 to 4.54 mt per year (Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catches}). Since 2000, annual total landings of `r spp` have ranged between 
`r paste0( min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] > 2000 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= Dat_end_mod1,2],0)), '-', max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] > 2000 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= Dat_end_mod1,2],0)) )` mt, with landings in `r Dat_end_mod1` totaling `r round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] == Dat_end_mod1,2],0)` mt.


`r spp` is not a major component of the commercial or recreational fisheries in southern California. 
There has been little discarding of the species in the commercial fisheries and the discard 
mortality rate for the recreational fisheries is estimated to be 7%.  The peak in discards 
from 2001-2005 was due to the closure of `r spp` fishery between two and 
ten months of the year during that period.

##Data and Assessment{-}




This a new full assessment for `r spp`, which was last assessed in 2005 [@Maunder2005] using 
Stock Synthesis II version 1.18.  This assessment uses the newest version of Stock Synthesis 
(3.30.05).  The model begins in `r Dat_start_mod1`, and assumes the stock 
was at an unfished equilibrium that year. In this assessment, aspects of the model including landings,
data, and modeling assumptions were re-evaluated. The assessment was conducted using the 
length- and age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.05.03).  The population 
was modeled allowing separate growth and mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model) 
from `r Dat_start_mod1` to `r LastYR`, and forecast beyond `r LastYR`.

All of the data sources for `r spp` have been re-evaluated for `r LastYR`, including the historical 
fishery catch-per-unit effort time-series. The landings history has been updated and extended back 
to `r Dat_start_mod1`. Harvest was negligible prior to that year. Survey data from five sources were used 
to develop indices of abundance: 1) Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) trawl surveys, 2) the NWFSC trawl survey, 3) 
a fishery-independent gill net survey, 4) the Southern California Bight regional monitoring program trawl 
survey, and 5) the onboard observer survey for retained catch. Length compositions were also created for 
each fishery-dependent and -independent data source, including a 
nuclear power generating station impingement survey that did not have an associated index of abundance. 
Conditional age-at-length information were available from the NWFSC trawl survey.

The definition of fishing fleets has changed from those in the 2005 assessment. 
Six fishing fleets were specified within this model: 1) a combined commercial hook-and-line, fish pot, 
and "other gear" fleet, 2) the commercial gill net 
fleet, 3) the commercial trawl fleet, 4) the recreational party/charter boat fleet (retained 
catch only), 5) the recreational private boat fleet (retained catch only), and 6) a discard 
fleet that combined the estimated discards from the recreational party/charter and private boat fleets.

The assessment uses landings data; catch-per-unit-effort and survey indices; length 
or age composition data for each year and fishery or survey (with conditional age-at-length 
composition data for the NWFSC trawl survey); information on weight-at-length; and 
estimates of ageing error. Model outputs include recruitment at "equilibrium spawning 
output", length-based selectivity of the fisheries and surveys, retention of the fishery, 
catchability of the surveys, growth, the time-series of spawning biomass, age and size structure, 
and current and projected future stock status. Natural mortality and steepness 
were fixed in the final model. This was done due to relatively flat likelihood surfaces, such that 
fixing parameters and then varying them in sensitivity analyses was deemed the best way to 
characterize uncertainty.

Although there are many types of data available for `r spp` since the 1980s which were 
used in this assessment, there is little information about steepness and natural mortality. 
Estimates of steepness are uncertain partly because of highly variable recruitment. 
Uncertainty in natural mortality is common in many fish stock assessments even when 
length and age data are available. 

A number of sources of uncertainty are now addressed in this assessment. This 
assessment includes gender differences in growth, an updated length-weight curve, and new 
conditional length at age data.  One of the largest sources of uncertainty that is not considered 
in the current model is the proportion of the stock in Mexico and the connectivity between the portion 
of the fishery in Mexican and U.S. waters. 
 
 
A base model was selected which best captures the central tendency for those sources of 
uncertainty considered in the model for the `r spp` stock in southern California 
(Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}).

##Stock Biomass{-}
The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a slight decline prior 
to 1965, when information on recruitment variability became available (Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} 
and Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}). A short, but sharp decline occurred between 1965 and
1985, followed by a period cyclical variation in spawning biomass, and then a decline from 2000 to 2015.
The stock showed increases in stock size in 2015 due to a combination of strong recruitment and 
smaller catches in 2015 and 2016.  The `r LastYR` estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished 
equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning biomass at `r Depl_mod1` 
(95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`) (Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). 
Approximate confidence intervals based on the 
asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning biomass is high.

##Recruitment{-}
Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1965-2016 (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all} and 
Table \ref{tab:Recruit_mod1}). Historically, there are estimates of large recruitment from 1975-1977, 1984-1985 and 
in 1993 and 1996.  There is early evidence of a strong recruitment in 2013.  The four 
lowest recruitment estimated within the model (in ascending order) occurred in 
`r recdev.lowest[1]`, `r recdev.lowest[2]`, `r recdev.lowest[3]`, and `r recdev.lowest[4]`.

##Exploitation status{-}
Harvest rates estimated by the base model have never exceeded
management target levels (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). 
Recent harvest rates have been relatively constant for the last decade. 
The estimated relative depletion is currently greater than the 40% unfished spawning 
output target. Recent exploitation rates on `r spp` were predicted to be significantly 
below target levels.

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.




##Reference Points{-}

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r mod1_label` is 
`r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the biomass 
target ($SB_{40\%}$), and well `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")` 
the minimum stock size threshold ($SB_{25\%}$). The estimated relative depletion level for the base 
model in `r LastYR+1` is 
`r Depl_mod1` (95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`, corresponding 
to an unfished spawning biomass of `r paste(Spawn_mod1, fecund_unit,sep=' ')` 
(95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(Spawn_mod1_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning biomass in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).  Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r Ref_pts_mod1[2,2]` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning biomass ($SB_{40\%}$) 
is `r paste(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, which corresponds with an 
equilibrium yield of `r Ref_pts_mod1[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt (Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all}).

##Management Performance{-}
 `r spp` has been managed as a single-species outside of a complex since 2003. 
 The estimated catch  of `r spp` north below the ACL in all years (2007-2017) except 
 for in 2014 when the catch exceeded the ACL (and ABC) by 6.8 mt. A summary of these values 
 as well as other base case summary results can be
found in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}.

##Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties{-}
As in most/all stock assessments, the appropriate value for stock-recruit 
steepness remains a major uncertainty for California scorpionfish. In this 
assessment a prior value from a meta-analysis of West Coast rockfish was used. 

Assessment results for the base model are sensitive to natural mortality.  When the 
natural mortality parameter is estimated by the model, the result is a value 
of female natural mortality that is higher than the STAT believed is biologically plausible. 
At the high value of female natural mortality also produced a stock with an estimated $lnR_0$ an
order of magnitude higher than when natural mortality was fixed at the prior.  Additional 
analyses and studies should be conducted to determine an appropriate prior distribution for 
California scorpionfish.

The time series of recruitment deviations is driving the trend in abundance in the base model. 
Initial explorations of mapping the estimated recruitment deviations to the CalCOFI sea surface 
temperature indicated correlations may be present.  Additional research should be conducted to 
explore the environmental drivers related to California scorpionfish recruitment.

The NMFS shelf-slope survey was the only available source of otoliths for California scorpionfish. 
It it unknown if the age and length distribution of the California scorpionfish deeper than 55 m 
(survey area) is the similar to that in waters shallower than 55 m.  The majority of California 
scorpionfish aged were males, and it is unknown if that was driven by the depth distribution, time 
of sampling, or other factors.

The current term of reference for stock assessment require development of a single decision
table with states of nature ranging along the dominant axis of uncertainty. This presumes
that uncertainty is consequential only for a single variable or estimated quantity, such as
natural mortality, steepness, or ending biomass. This approach may fail to capture important
elements of uncertainty that should be communicated to the Council and its advisory bodies.
Additional flexibility in the development of decision tables is needed.

\FloatBarrier




##Decision Table{-}    
The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the final base model, 
with the forecasted projections of the OFL presented in Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}. The
total catches in 2017 and 2018 are set to the PFMC adopted California scorpionfish ACL of 
150 mt. 

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon at the STAR panel 
and are based on a low value of $M$, 0.164, the base model value of $M$, 0.235, and 
a high value, 0.2745. The decision table based sigma was larger than the value for a category one species of 0.36. 
Therfore, the sigma was estimated as 0.582 from $(ln(BaseSpawnOut2017) - ln(LowSpawnOut2017))/1.15$.  The resulting 
buffer, given a $p^* = 0.45$, was 0.929.  The total catches in 2017 and 2018 are set to 
the average annual catch from 2015-2016 (79.03) and not the ABC or OFL due recent trends in total catch 
being significantly lower than the OFL and ABC. The average of 2015-2016 catch by fleet was used to distribute 
catches in forecasted years. Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature 
project that the stock, under the current control rule as applied to the base model, will decline 
towards the target stock size Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1}. The current control rule under the 
low state of nature results in a stock decline into the precautionary zone, while the high state of 
nature maintains the stock at nearer unfished levels. Removing the high $M$
catches under the base model $M$ and high $M$ states of nature results in the population going
remaining at a level of spawning biomass during the projection period, and higher initial values of $lnR_0$.

##Research and Data Needs{-}
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

There are a number of areas of research that could improve the stock 
assessment for California scorpionfish.  Below are issues identified by the STAT team 
and the STAR panel:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Natural mortality}: Both natural mortality and steepness were 
fixed in the base model.  The natural mortality estimate used the assessment 
was based on maximum age. The collection of age data for older females may improve 
the ability to estimate female natural mortality in the model.  The NWFSC trawl survey
was the only available source of age data for this assessment, of which there were a 
number of age-1 fish and the data were dominated by males.  It may also be possible 
to evaluate mortality by quantifying predation by major predators of scorpionfish, 
such as octopus. 

A tagging study to estimate natural mortality for scorpionfish should be 
considered.  This project could be designed as a cooperative research project 
with the charter fleet in southern California.

\item \textbf{Steepness}: California scorpionfish has not been fished to a level 
where information on steepness is available.  A meta-analysis of steepness should be done for 
species with the same reproductive strategy as scorpionfish.


\item \textbf{Stock south of the U.S. border}:  No available information on the status of California 
scorpionfish in Mexico could be found.  A number of emails were sent to researchers 
in Mexico and none were returned.  It is known that a portion of the stock resides 
in Mexico and that boat leaving from San Diego target California scorpionfish off 
the Coronado Islands.  

\item \textbf{Sex ratio}:  The sex ratio in the only published work by Love et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love1987}{1987}) and samples 
from the NWFSC trawl survey were skewed towards males. Data on sex ratios from the 
recreational or commercial fisheries would help in determining the sex ratio of the population.


\item \textbf{Aggregating behavior}: Aggregative behavior in both spawning and 
non-spawning seasons of California scorpionfish is not well understood. Studies are 
needed to evaluate the environmental or ecological conditions that govern this behavior.



\item \textbf{Fecundity/maturity}: A reproductive biology study of California 
scorpionfish is needed.There are currently no estimates of fecundity 
for California scorpionfish.  The hard copies of data from the only
estimates of maturity for California scorpionfish by Love et al. 
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love1987}{1987}) are no longer available.  
Some data on the spatial distribution of the 
eggs are available from CalCOFI, but were not keypunched to the species level. 
California scorpionfish mature at a young age, and additional data can help 
inform the maturity ogive.

No studies have been done of the relationship between weight and reproductive 
output.  California scorpionfish have a different reproductive strategy than rockfish, 
and seasonal protection of spawning areas may help maintain reproductive capacity 
of the stock.

\item \textbf{Discard mortality}: Many scorpionfish are discarded at sea. The assessment 
used estimates of discard mortality of a distantly related species (lingcod) 
in a different ecological setting (Karpov \protect\hyperlink{ref-Karpov1996}{1996}). 
Studies of discard mortality are needed 
to parametrize the assessment model.

\item \textbf{Environmental covariates}: The relationship between environmental 
conditions and recruitment for scorpionfish should be further explored. Preliminary 
exploration using CalCOFI temperature data suggested that a relationship existed, 
but other time series may correlate more strongly given that scorpionfish are a 
near-shore species.  Scorpionfish appear to be a relatively hardy and adaptable 
species and may expand northward in a warming climate.  


\item \textbf{Stephens and MacCall filtering}: Ad hoc criteria are used to identify 
a threshold when applying the Stephens and MacCall method of selecting records for 
CPUE index development.  Further research is needed to determine whether threshold 
selection criteria can be optimized.


\item \textbf{Discard fleet modeling}: Modeling discard as a separate fleet, as 
was done for California scorpionfish, is a simple and intuitive approach, but 
the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are unclear. This method should 
be compared to the more standard approach of modeling discard with retention 
curves to ensure the model results are not strongly affected by the method used.


\item \textbf{MCMC in Stock Synthesis}: The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
method implemented in Stock Synthesis is not reliable in many cases.  
Characterizing uncertainty of the final assessment model is important, and 
MCMC offers advantages over asymptotic approximations using the Hessian or 
likelihood profiles. 

\item \textbf{Decision tables}: Several alternative approaches were used this 
year to construct decision tables and some approaches may be better than others. 
The stock assessment TOR should outline the various methods that can be used, 
and provide recommendations if possible on preferred approaches.


\item \textbf{POTW trawl surveys}: Additional biological information 
(sex, otoliths, depth distribution) should be collected for California 
scorpionfish during the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) trawl 
survey and the Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Project 
(SCCWRP) trawl survey.

\item \textbf{Age validation}: An age validation study is needed for 
California scorpionfish.


\item \textbf{CalCOFI}: CalCOFI ichthyoplankton surveys in southern California 
do not currently identify scorpionfish eggs to species, though it is possible to 
do this in southern California waters. Species-specific identification of 
scorpionfish eggs is recommended to develop spawning output index for use in 
the next stock assessment.
