# Background

## California scorpionfish *Scorpaena guttata*

\begin{itemize} 
 \item[\checkmark] Distributed from central California to Punta Eugenia, Baja Mexico  
 \item[\checkmark] Rarely observed north of Pt. Conception  
 \item[\checkmark] Observed from the intertidal to 600 ft,  preferred depth range from 20-450 ft  
 \item[\checkmark] Demersal, found over both hard and soft bottom  
 \item[\checkmark] Exhibit aggregating behavior (spawning and non-spawning)  
\end{itemize}

# Biology

## Length-at-age



## Maturity and Fecundity

* Only information on maturity from Love et al. (1987)
* Found over 50% of females were mature by 18 cm TL, or two years of age. 
* All fish were mature by 22 cm TL

* No information available on fecundity of California scorpionfish

## Summary of Indices

- All of the methods used to standardize indices have been endorsed by the SSC

```{r, results = 'asis'}
    # Years read in as factor - change to shorten.
      Index_summary$Years = as.character(Index_summary$Years)
      Index_summary[7,2] = paste0("'94, '98, '03, '08, '13")
      Index_summary = Index_summary[,c(3,2,4,6)]

    # Print index summary table
      print(xtable(Index_summary,
                   align = 'lp{2.5in}p{0.8in}p{.4in}p{2in}'),
            include.rownames=FALSE,
            scalebox = 0.7,
            sanitize.text.function = function(x){x})
```
