###Biological Parameters and Data

California scorpionfish do not have a forked tail, therefore total 
length and fork length are equal. Love et al.  [-@Love1987]  provide conversion factors
between standard length (SL) and total length (TL): $TL = 1.21SL + 1.02$ and $SL = 0.82TL - 0.69$.
 
Standard and total lengths of 163 California scorpionfish  were available from a 
halibut trawl survey in southern California (Steve Wertz, CDFW).  The conversion 
from SL to TL from these data was estimated at $TL = 1.2225SL + 0.7773$. 
The conversion originating from the halibut trawl data was used in this assessment 
due to the fact that the original data from Love et al.  [-@Love1987] are not available. 
The majority of available length composition data were measured to total length, 
except for the POTW trawl surveys, the Southern California
Bight Regional Monitoring Program trawl survey, and the CSUN/VRG gillnet survey 
(gillnet survey).  Maunder et al. [-@Maunder2005] converted all data to standard 
length due to clumping of data when length data are only available to the nearest 
centimeter. However, the same is true for the conversion from TL to SL when data 
were available to the nearest centimeter. All length data for this assessment are in
TL.  The Orange County Sanitation District and the VRG gillnet study measured SL 
to the nearest mm.
 
To avoid missing length bins (specifically 18, 23, 29 cm) in the conversion from SL 
to TL,  0.5 was first subtracted from each SL and a random uniform number (U[0, 1]) 
was added to the SL measurement.  All TL measurements were rounded to the nearest 
length centimeter length bin.  A comparison of the length distributions

*Recreational: California MRFSS and CRFS Length Composition Data*

Individual fish lengths recorded by MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2011) samplers were
downloaded from the RecFIN website (www.recfin.org). CRFS data from 2012-2014 were
obtained directly from CDFW.

**Age Structures**

Age data were provided from the NWFSC trawl survey from 2005-2016, and all of
the otoliths collected from the survey were aged.  Figures \ref{fig:otolith1} and 
\ref{fig:otolith2} provide examples of California scorpionfish
 otoliths read (including double-reads) 
 by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon. 
A total of 879 otoliths were read, and ranged from 0-29 years of age. 
Fewer than 1% (8 fish) were aged 22 years or older,
 and only one age-0 fish was in the sample (Figure \ref{fig:Agelength}).

Males and females exhibit different growth patterns, i.e., females 
grow faster than males (Figure \ref{fig:Agelength}).
Sex-specific length-at-age was initially estimated external to the population dynamics models 
using the von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonB1938], $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, 
where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in years, $k$ is rate of 
increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic length.
The external parameter estimates for females were $L{\infty}=31.613, k = 0.250, t_0 = -2.280$,
and for males $L{\infty}=27.374, k = 0.233, t_0 = -2.092$ (Figure \ref{fig:vonB_compare}).

**Aging Precision and Bias**

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 200 California 
scorpionfish otoliths with two age reads (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_ageerror}). 
Age-composition data used in the model were all from the NWFSC trawl survey and 
were from otoliths reads aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, 
Oregon. All of the otolith reads were from Age Reader A, and double reads were read
by Age Reader B.  Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias and standard deviation were the same for both 
readers, unbiased and curvilinear increase in standard deviation with age, 
respectively (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet8_NWFSCTrawl_ageerror2}).  Two fish with 
estimated age greater than 21 (plus group age) were excluded from the ageing error 
estimation. The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.001 years to a standard deviation of 1.79 years at age 22.

**Weight-Length**

The weight-length relationship is based on the standard power function: 
$W = \alpha(L^\beta)$ where $W$ is individual weight (kg), $L$ is length (cm), 
and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients used as constants.

Sex-specific weight-length relationships were estimated from the NWFSC trawl 
survey data.  Length and weight data were available for 340 females and 530 
males.  The estimated parameters for females are $\alpha = 1.553983e^{-05}$ and
$\beta = 3.057654$, and for males $\alpha = 1.9104e^{-05}$ and
$\beta = 2.980548$.  Love et al. [-@Love1987] found males to be heavier at a given 
length than females, whereas the NWFSC data suggests the opposite (Figure \ref{fig:Length_weight}).

The original data from Love et al. [-@Love1987] are no longer available (Milton Love, personal 
communication, UC Santa Barbara) to re-examine the trends.  The weight-length relationships 
estimated from the NWFSC survey are consistent with the sex-specific growth rates and are 
used in the assessment model.

**Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity**

The NWFSC trawl survey is the only study available with raw data on sex ratios by age. 
Across all ages, the sex ratio from the aged California scorpionfish from the NWFSC trawl 
survey was 60% males and 40% females (Table \ref{tab:sex_ratio}). At age-1, 39% of the aged 
fish were female (29 of 85), 
but the sex of 10 fish was unknown.  For ages two to five, the percent of female 
fish ranged from 45-54%, with aged fish older than five dominated by males. The assessment 
assumed a sex ratio at birth was 1:1.  The NWFSC trawl survey samples a minimum depth of 55 m 
and no information on sex ratios was available from other surveys.

Love et al. [-@Love1987] conducted the only published life history study of California 
scorpionfish, but did not report information on sex ratios.  Differing numbers of sample 
sizes (males and females) were used for each part of the study (ex. maturity and 
length-at-age).  The raw data from this study are no longer available, and we were 
not able to determine raw samples sizes by sex.

No new data on maturity or fecundity for California scorpionfish are available 
since the publication of the 2005 stock assessment. Love et al. [-@Love1987] found 
few California scorpionfish to be mature at age-1, 50% of males were mature at 17 cm TL 
and over 50% of females were mature by 18 cm TL, or two years of age. All fish were mature 
by 22 cm TL.   This assessment used size at 50% maturity 
for females of 18 cm TL, with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish.  

The 2005 assessment model combined information from estimated linear 
gonadal somatic index and maturity based on standard length [@Maunder2005].  However, the 
study used to estimate the GSI, was a halibut targeted trawl study using a mesh size of 10.2 cm 
(Steven Wertz, personal communication, CDFW). This assessment assumed linear relationship for eggs 
per kilogram.

**Natural Mortality**
Hamel [-@Hamel2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches to 
relating the natural mortality rate $M$ to other life-history parameters such as 
longevity, size, growth rate and reproductive effort, to provide a prior on M. In 
that same issue of ICESJMS, Then et al. [-@Then2015], provided an updated data set 
of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish 
species, from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They 
concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an 
updated Hoenig non-linear least squares (nls) estimator $M= 4.899*{A_{max}}^{-.916}$. 
The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already 
being used for west coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative 
model forms relating $-.916M$ to $A_{max}$, Then et al. [-@Then2015] did not 
consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would 
expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error 
associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{max}$. Therefore, it would 
be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done.
Revaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@Then2015] by fitting the one-parameter 
$A_{max}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be 
-1 in the transformed space (as in Hamel [-@Hamel2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:
\begin{equation}
M = \frac{5.4}{A_{max}}
\end{equation}
 
The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal with 
mean $ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}$  and SE = 0.4384343 (Owen Hamel, personal communication, NMFS). 
Using a maximum age of 21 the 
point estimate and median of the prior is 0.2545, which is used as a prior for 
females in the assessment model.

###Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the Assessment
In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations were explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.
